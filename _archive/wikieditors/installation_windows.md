## Local installation (Windows)

### Prerequisites for the SDK installation.

In order to install the SDK in a container (recommended) you should have the docker software suite. You can find instructions for most operating systems [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

For Windows the only method today is to have a linux (Ubuntu) virtual machine installed in which you install the SDK.  We are working on a native Docker installation for windows but this might take a few more weeks.  

For installing the Ubuntu virtual machine please download the Oracle virtualbox software [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

Then you need a copy of the ubuntu operating system.  For this the server version is [sufficient](https://ubuntu.com/download/server).  Please install with default features in a virtualbox VM.  There are many tutorials available online, both web and video here's one that is [recent](https://hibbard.eu/install-ubuntu-virtual-box/)

Once this is done, the installation instructions for the Jumpscale SDK with take you further.

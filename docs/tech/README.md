# ThreeFold Tech

## Who are we?

ThreeFold Tech is a technology development company that is passionate about making a meaningful IMPACT on humanity and our planet.

ThreeFold Tech has developed a disruptive stack of technology which can be used individually or combined. By design, this technology stack is responsible and democratized, protecting privacy, neutrality and security, whilst being inclusive to all of humanity. 

We are a motivated group of people who mean well and are passionate about creating a universal shift in digital ethics by embedding responsibility in the design, core values and code. We have a credible track-record having successfully grown multiple tech companies to date (see www.incubaid.com). 

We have a truly unique technology which sits at the crossroads of a number of interesting, intersecting tech trends in the IT market including: blockchain, edge cloud computing & self-healing IT systems. 

Our disruptive technology is used by the ThreeFold Foundation to empower its Responsible Internet initiative. A fully democratized and distributed grid of internet capacity that is, by design, responsible and democratized, protecting individual privacy, neutrality, and security, whilst being inclusive to all of humanity.

## New to ThreeFold Tech?

The market capitalization of all the blockchain-based new players is today several billion USD today and yet the sum of all their capacity online today is less than 10% of the connected online capacity of the ThreeFold Grid. In other words, we are completely unknown today, yet still we are 10 times bigger than all of these new blockchain-based disruptors combined. Our market capitalization, as measured by TFT in circulation, is only 18 million USD. We have chosen not to hype our movement but grow it in a responsible and ethical way (read non hyped).

We are still a small group of people and as such we need partners to help us to reach the world e.g. HP Enterprise wants to help us to deliver capacity to the world. We also work together with a global NGO who help more than 150,000 farmers in developing countries.  This NGO wants to become a ThreeFold Farmer and show others how to do this to bring internet to locations where it's most needed. This NGO wants to investigate with ThreeFold if we can introduce new digital currencies like a Coffee Token which are potentially a new source of funding for the coffee farmers.

## How do we compare ?

How do we compare to other projects? Anyone who needs cloud (compute,storage) capacity today can either buy this capacity from the traditional cloud or go to the new players, who are mainly blockchain companies. We are different.

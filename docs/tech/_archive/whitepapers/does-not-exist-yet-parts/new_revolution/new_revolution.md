# **Decentralization is the new revolution.**

![balloon in clouds](new_revolution1.png)

The world right now has known a long period of peace (+60 years). [Liberalism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/liberalism) was the engine behind this prosperous period. Some claim that [Liberalism as we know it, could come at to an end](https://www.tttdebates.org/is-liberalism-dead/). 

People are looking for what's next and decentralization could be the next step in human evolution. This trend started with Blockchain, very interesting technology, and the first step in this evolution but not going far enough yet.

Thanks to the blockchain hype, a new business trend has been created, and the current solutions are only the beginning. It's a trend where customers want to see more decentralization. People want to have more control over their own lives. They don’t want to become a meaningful piece inside a big Artificial Intelligence machine.

## **Is Blockchain the holy grail for decentralization?**

Blockchain has been painted as the holy grail of decentralization and new types of collaboration, but it has quite some issues:

* Non Efficient by design

    * Power hungry

    * Slow and Unscalable..

    * inefficient in the usage of IT resources (too many copies of data, …).

* Not decentralized ([taxonomy report](https://cryptodisrupt.com/taxonomy-report-2018-only-16-of-crypto-assets-are-decentralized/),  [decentralization vs distributed](https://medium.com/nakamo-to/whats-the-difference-between-decentralized-and-distributed-1b8de5e7f5a4), [hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/decentralized-data-why-blockchain-is-meaningless-and-trustless-is-everything-318fd14d3827), [blockgeeks](https://blockgeeks.com/decentralization-has-become-synonymous-with-blockchain-but-is-it-the-truth/))

* Private blockchains do not exist ([hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/why-there-are-no-private-blockchains-in-nature-cb14b5fc1fb4), [coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/how-i-lost-my-faith-in-private-blockchains))

* Greed has been [too much of a driving factor](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/15/blockchain-democracy-decentralisation-bitcoin-price-cryptocurrencies). 

* Often misunderstood & hyped ([the verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/7/17091766/blockchain-bitcoin-ethereum-cryptocurrency-meaning))

Many people believe Blockchain is the solution to decentralization, but the way how we use blockchains today is not realistic. Example today Ethereum blockchain is already 1 TB in size and it's only the beginning. The current way of using Blockchain technology is too inefficient (too many copies, power hungry, long lookup times, …)

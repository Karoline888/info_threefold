## **indexing & search problem**

![huge library image](indexing1.png)

A difficult problem in a fully decentralized system is how to index and search for information.

When an author (in a company or private context) creates content, he/she needs to define access rights to one or more circles. If giving read access to the universe circle it basically means everyone can retrieve the information. Each piece of information also needs to get labels, these are labels you freely choose and not necessarily have a meaning outside of your own environment.

There are some automatic labels like type of document, creation data, location of creation (e.g. photo), …

An author can define which part of the document (if not all) is available for indexation.

In the TF Grid there are aggregation providers which are deployed (paid for) and owned by a specific 3bot.

These aggregation providers list themselves into the aggregator blockchain.

Example aggregators

* A facebook alternative.

* An Airbnb alternative 

* An Uber alternative

* A football club directory

* A city merchants organization

Each aggregator is basically a 3bot who got rights to query indexing and/or the information behind.

Each 3bot (as instructed by their owners) needs to inform the required aggregators to index/access the information (in a broad sense: video, address details, documents, news, ...)  as stored in the 3bot.

The 3bot can use a combination of labels and circles to do so.

Example, you create blog articles about food and want to be listed on an aggregator site of healthy food. You found this aggregation site because of consulting the aggregator blockchain (of course there are nice tools available to make this user-friendly). You can now instruct your 3bot to list all your relevant blog articles with labels food & healthy to that aggregator. The aggregator will now receive instructions to index the information and list it in its own application to the intended audience. The aggregator has the right to accept the information or not. The aggregator can make a commercial business out of it and can decide to give part of the income to the original authors of the information using e.g. TFTs. 

Important to note, the information itself does not get stored on the aggregator site, only when creating the index. The required index information is being provided and used to create the index. This means that e.g. sensitive information will stay on the author 3bot only fields relevant for indexing will go to the aggregator.

This system is super scalable because aggregator sites by themselves are limited in scope and do pre-sorting of information people look for. E.g. an Uber alternative only makes sense in a certain region, no point to have a global Uber aggregation site. It's even possible to create aggregators of aggregator sites.
Sites which make it easy to query information over multiple aggregators.

Any 3bot can decide to pay the required TFT’s to run an aggregation site and register the capabilities and goal of the aggregation site in the aggregation blockchain.

This system makes it possible to avoid centralization completely.

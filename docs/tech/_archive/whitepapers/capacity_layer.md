# White Paper Takeaways

1. **To deliver the required compute and storage capabilities for the exponential growth in digital services, Information Technology needs to be substantially overhauled so that it can exist everywhere – in datacenters, in homes, in cars, in lamp posts, in mobile masts, without having local or remote administration needs (autonomous).**

2. **Efficiency gains are mandatory to deliver the exponentially-growing needs. Hardware innovation does not follow Moore’s law anymore and we cannot rely on hardware to fuel the increased needs.**

3. **A new technology paradigm is needed separating utility (compute and storage) operations from complex application deployments. Compute and Storage need to become the "electricity" that fuels the information age.**

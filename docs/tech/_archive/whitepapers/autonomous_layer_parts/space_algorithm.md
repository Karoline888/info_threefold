### The "Space Algorithm" of storage

The ThreeFold system uses dispersed storage algorithms and is very different in nature.

In a dispersed storage system the data gets dispersed in such a way that data will always be available even if 4 sites of the 20 (in this case) would not be available. Redundancy is the same as in the above example but the overhead is 20x less. It also has clear benefits from a security and efficiency perspective.

This has been originally invented for communication in space.

ThreeFold Technology Whitepaper: 

Autonomous Layer

Author: Kristof de Spiegeleer

Version: 1.0

# Introduction

TF Tech is a software company that has developed technology capable to run any IT workload 100% autonomously. This document describes how TF Tech 3Bot technology can make this happen.

For the last couple of years, blockchain was synonymous with decentralization. We believe this is not true â€“ most blockchains are not decentralized at all. They are distributed systems, but not decentralized.

Real de**central**ization is still centralized but in a different way. In our way of decentralization, we believe that you and your organizations need to become the center of your digital life.

We believe every human or legal entity should have a digital avatar, our digital self. This avatar is an application running in a well-protected environment, is online all the time, and can speak to any other digital avatar in all freedom, and with all efficiency. Much like how cells work in our body, all together we create a functioning digital world, by collaboration.

# White Paper Takeaways

1. **Blockchain technology is here to stay but is not the single answer to the exponential growth requirements of digital services.**

2. **Centralization of data ownership and storage is not bad if the owner is the creator of the data, not the aggregator.**

3. **A new technology paradigm is needed to bring blockchain technologies and decentralized compute and storage together.**

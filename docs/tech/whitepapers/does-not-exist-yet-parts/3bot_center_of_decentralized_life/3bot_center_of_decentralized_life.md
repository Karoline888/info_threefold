A 3bot has been designed to be as efficient as possible. The current memory footprint is less than 200 MB yet still it is a wiki system, database, blockchain, web server, indexing & search machine, e-commerce system, wallet, decentralized exchange, … It can manage millions of objects and is the center of your company or you’re digital life.

To create this 3bot we had no choice than to restart from scratch and re-invent a lot because existing IT components are too centralized and often too inefficient (e.g. memory hungry).

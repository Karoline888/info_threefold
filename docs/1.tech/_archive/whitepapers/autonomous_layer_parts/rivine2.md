## The Rivine blockchain: a blockchain for storing value 

### TFT or any other digital currency Blockchain

The Rivine technology is used to manage the ThreeFold Grid main currency. It provides an effective way to have a high transaction volume blockchain to run the token economy that is part of the ThreeFold Foundation. This same blockchain technology can be used to manage any type of digital currency.

### Digital Currency Blockchain As A Service

Complementary Digital currencies are here to stay. Complementary currencies are not new and have always been around to compensate for when main (fiat) currencies fail. In the last decade, digital complementary currencies have gained interest and respect of many people globally. They represent opportunities for people that have no access to traditional banking services. They provide alternative means of value transfer between individuals and legal entities, making it more effective, with lower cost, and independent of traditional value exchange mechanisms.

Like traditional mileage systems of airlines (which is an example of a complementary digital currency) many more of these will come into existence over the next couple of years. The local football club might come up with their own value exchange mechanism for running their own internal economy in such a way that is specific to the football club, branded to the football club, and has supporters exchanging value amongst each other, with the fan shop, in the cafeteria, and canteens.

With the Rivine technology and the TF Grid as a platform to run on, anyone can start their own digital currency for a particular use case. The Rivine technology will create a system for value exchange and the necessary governance and consensus by people who co-own and operate the specific local blockchain.

# **A 100% decentralized IT system does not exist yet?**

Does this system exist today? Also at ThreeFold Tech, we are not there yet **but we are very close.**

Probably further advanced compared to any other startup or technology vendor.

We had to re-invent a blockchain, an operating system, and a self-healing IT system.

## **But we are very close.**

Our Zero-OS & Zero-Chain is usable and deployed today. The ThreeFold Grid is the first deployment of this unique technology and has been activated Q2 2018 (read [whitepaper here](http://whitepaper.threefold.me)).

There are more than 18.000 CPU cores and 40.000.000 GB of storage activated with this technology.

We used our previous generation of self-healing technology to deploy all of this capacity. This Zero-Robot is not fully decentralized yet.

Since then we have been working on new technology which is making our 3bot service possible.

This technology is not ready for prime time yet. We are close to launching an upgrade in our TF Grid where the usage of 3bot technology will be introduced. We estimate it will take us till end of 2019 till we can call our TF Grid 100% decentralized and self-healing.

In the meantime, we are working with some chosen technology partners to roll out commercial products.

<p>By using the sidebar as navigation, you can see all the terms and concepts we have defined.</p>
<p>If you would like to see another definition added, please email us at info@threefold.io.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#threefold-values" id="threefold-values">ThreeFold Values</a></h2>
<p>ThreeFold has three main values or pillars :</p>
<p><strong>Equality</strong> | The Internet should be inclusive to all of humanity. We are building an Internet that is owned by many, can be deployed everywhere, and is accessible to all. Everyone should enjoy a fair return for their provided value. There is no reason for middlemen in a peer-to-peer economy.</p>
<p><strong>Freedom</strong> | The Internet should be responsible and democratized, respectful of individual privacy, neutral, and secure, and provide freedom to  all stakeholders. Everyone should own their own data just like they own their experiences in reality.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainability</strong> | We need an Internet that is environmentally conscious, where networks, hardware and software components, as well as processes are optimized around energy-efficiency and carbon neutrality as much as possible.</p>
<p><strong>ThreeFold Network</strong></p>
<p>The ThreeFold Network is an Internet that empowers equality, freedom, and sustainability. It is created by three layers of technology – the capacity layer, the autonomous layer, and the experience layer (further defined in this section).</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#autonomous-layer" id="autonomous-layer">Autonomous Layer</a></h2>
<p>You can think about this layer as similar to a bee hive, where worker bees create complex “magic” by performing quite simple yet necessary tasks altogether.</p>
<p>Imagine the autonomous layer as being the bridge between users and the capacity layer. The system is self-driving and self-healing, therefore removing the human requirement for deploying and operating IT infrastructure and services, and vastly minimizing the possibility of hacking. This represents a major breakthrough in IT.</p>
<p>The autonomous layer is where 3Bots live and interact with each other. With 3Bot, free yourself from an app-centric system and enter a more secure, neutral, and decentralized digital world designed with you in the center. Your digital identity and data is fully protected as 3Bot is stateless and decentralized by design.  3Bot is still in development and the vision is to undertake 80% of your current digital workloads.</p>
<p>Some key characteristics include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fair: All access to data and information can be revoked at any time. That means 3Bot users retain full ownership of their data.</li>
<li>Efficient: The unique architecture makes accessing the data much more efficient than today - saving 90% energy and bandwidth.</li>
<li>Autonomous: Deploys and operates the infrastructure without human interaction. </li>
<li>Resilient: The self-healing operating system ensures that in the unlikely case that a node goes down, your data remains private and available.</li>
<li>Trustless: No controlling centralized institution. In 3Bots peer-to-peer architecture, everyone is equal.</li>
<li>Secure: 2FA login, peer-reviews, KYC integration, a decentralized ledger and lean coding ensure highest security standards.</li>
<li>Compatible: 3Bot technology mimics the protocols of older, centralized servers for e-mail (IMAP, SMTP, POP3), contacts (Caldav), and files  (Webdav, FTP). That way it can blend in with existing smartphones and access existing applications while still providing all of its features.</li>
<li>Complete: 3Bot removes the need to store digital information like calendar entries or photos in several locations. It is the best place to store your complete digital life.</li>
<li>Developer friendly: Developing applications for 3Bot it easy and quick. Decluttered architecture together with our system development kit save 90% of development effort compared to conventional centralized applications.</li>
<li>Open source: We believe in sharing information and are inviting the world to build on our work.</li>
</ul>
<p>3Bot is currently in Beta version. Follow our announcements regarding the upcoming implementations at https://forum.threefold.io/ or https://t.me/threefoldnetwork.</p>
<p>You can already reserve your 3Bot name through 3Bot Connect that is already available on Android and iOS. 3Bot connect is the gateway to 3Bot and provides private and secure logins to all of its components.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#capacity-layer" id="capacity-layer">Capacity Layer</a></h2>
<p>Much in the way the trees and plants in a forest communicate and share nutrients through underground channels, the capacity layer includes an expanding grid of intelligent connection for the ThreeFold Network.</p>
<p>Think of the capacity layer as being the foundation of the Internet. It consists of hardware and software components that together form the physical infrastructure needed to make all experiences possible. Without storage and computing capacity, there would be no Internet.</p>
<p>The ThreeFold Grid is the most advanced decentralized network of compute and storage on the planet. It is a more performant and sustainable alternative to centralized cloud providers with about 40PB deployed in 21+ countries. Any application which can run on Linux can run on the ThreeFold Grid but with more privacy, security, closer to the end-user, and at a much lower cost. Any individual or organization can already utilize ThreeFold Grid capacity for any current or future IT workload.</p>
<p>Some key characteristics include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decentralized: Consists of 3Nodes - affordable, secure and highly efficient cloud storage units that can be purchased and hosted by anyone for about 1000 USD.</li>
<li>Efficient:  Algorithms ensure the data is hosted where it is needed.</li>
<li>Secure: A storage algorithm inspired by space-technology is used and ensures the integrity of all data, even if some nodes go offline.</li>
<li>Sustainable: Being decentralized and using the greenest hardware available, the ThreeFold Grid is able to save 90% energy compared to conventional data centers. </li>
<li>Tamperproof: Algorithms prove that workloads on the ThreeFold Grid are executed as intended.</li>
<li>Affordable: Data hosted on the ThreeFold Grid costs 70% less compared to other cloud providers.</li>
<li>Fair: People that run 3Nodes are called farmers. They are remunerated and incentivized to constantly expand the ThreeFold Grid by generating ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) for the capacity provided.</li>
<li>Open source: All the technology is available on GitHub. Join us and let’s build a better digital world together.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#experience-layer" id="experience-layer">Experience Layer</a></h2>
<p>This layer is where the human imagination and experience come into play. It is where users can access different sets of experiences (communication &amp; messaging, file manager, browser, website builder, wiki, collaboration tools, decentralized digital wallet, and more) and where creators can build new experiences. The possibilities are endless. This is the layer that best represents the current user experience with today’s Internet – the applications and services we use regularly, but now with humans at the center and in control.</p>
<p>Any web technology can be used to create the most amazing applications. The advanced architecture of ThreeFold saves 90% of development efforts to develop new applications or convert existing solutions. All applications employ secured login through 3Bot Connect to fulfill the highest standards in security and privacy.</p>
<p>Please reach out to info@threefold.io if you are interested in creating applications and experiences on top of ThreeFold.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#threefold-grid-tf-grid" id="threefold-grid-tf-grid">ThreeFold Grid (TF Grid)</a></h1>
<p><img src="docs/grid//images/world.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The ThreeFold Grid is built by independent people that together create a pool of connected compute and storage capacity.  This is a tokenomy where compute hardware mints a stable currency (the TF Token) which is used to rent capacity on the grid to run current and future IT workloads.  The currency should be a stable currency and ThreeFold hopes it will be a currency that us used in local economies for many other value transaction ad well.</p>
<p>This WIKI presents the basic information required to participate in the ThreeFold Grid.  There are a number of different ways to use the technology:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>as a farmer minting ThreeFold tokens</strong>:
farmers investment in hardware to build and operate the internet capacity pool.  Farmers purchase and operate compute and storage hardware that they list on the TF Grid by downloading and installing ThreeFold software.  A farmer mints the ThreeFold token(s).  Farmers come in many different size and shapes.  Farmers can be individuals that have a spare computer or some spare cash.  Farmers can also be companies that actively go out and find people to invest in there business of building farming sites and mint Threefold tokens.  An example of with a company is <a href="https://www.greenedgecloud.com/">Green Edge Cloud</a></li>
<li><strong>as a developer using the TF grid to create and run IT workloads by using Farmers capacity</strong>:
these are people that build services and applications on the TF Grid.</li>
<li><strong>as a customer is using applications and services developed by developers on Farmers capacity</strong>:<br />
customers use applications on the TF Grid and consume TF Grid resources for which they pay in TF tokens.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a class="header" href="#introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>We probably don’t need to tell you that the invention of Blockchain technology changed the world dramatically. The ThreeFold application of Blockchain technology to compute and storage capacity is one of the most exciting initiatives we have seen to date.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-problem" id="the-problem">The problem</a></h2>
<p>There are some major challenges with the current foundation of the internet and how it has moved from being a medium to independently share information amongst internet users to a multi-billion dollar industry governed by a few (American) companies.</p>
<p><img src="docs/grid/tf_farming/../images/problem.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-solution" id="the-solution">The solution</a></h2>
<p>The ThreeFold Foundation has the key to change the internet for good, and you might want to play a big role in this. And so can you! By becoming a farmer you are taking part in that process. You are contributing to a significant increase in Net Neutrality which has come under serious threat in recent years. You are helping to build a more sustainable Internet for generations to come by giving the internet back to the people.</p>
<p>The ThreeFold Foundation has created end-to-end technology that creates a very stable (crypto) currency with neutral, private and distributed capacity generating hardware as a financial backing mechanism.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-ecosystem" id="the-ecosystem">The ecosystem</a></h2>
<p>The ThreeFold Ecosystem is a token economy where tokens (crypto currency) are being generated (and therefore financially backed) by internet capacity generating equipment, owned by anyone and housed anywhere, building and creating internet capacity owned and operated by all of us, creating wealth and business opportunities for anyone in the world while building a rock-solid foundation for a currency that is less volatile than any other (crypto) currency.</p>
<p><img src="docs/grid/tf_farming/../images/TF_ecosystem.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>What is more, all Farmers who sign up now to purchase internet capacity servers or create capacity pools are amongst the first doing so and therefore they enjoy a higher return on investment than people that will join at a later stage.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#what-are-threefold-tokens-tft" id="what-are-threefold-tokens-tft">What are ThreeFold Tokens (TFT)?</a></h1>
<p>ThreeFold Token (TFT) is a decentralized digital currency used to buy autonomous and decentralized Internet services (compute, storage, and application) on the ThreeFold Network. </p>
<p>The ThreeFold Token represents a unit of reservation of autonomous Internet capacity on the TF Grid. Capacity is a new high-demand market, and TFT will be the medium of exchange for this commodity. TFT synergistically connects the world of cloud and blockchain markets to the most scalable universal substrate without compromising, performance, security and privacy.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#farming-tfts" id="farming-tfts">Farming TFT's</a></h2>
<p>ThreeFold Tokens are generated through a process called &quot;Farming&quot;. Farming happens when active internet capacity is added to the ThreeFold Grid. Independent farmers earn ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) by providing neutral and decentralized internet capacity, thus expending the usable Grid. Therefore no central entity controls the internet.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#why-buy-threefold-tokens-tft" id="why-buy-threefold-tokens-tft">Why buy ThreeFold Tokens (TFT)?</a></h1>
<p>ThreeFold Token (TFT) is not your average decentralized digital currency. TFT's are supported by a tangible underlying economy of autonomous and decentralized Internet infrastructure and services called the ThreeFold Network (compute, storage, applications). The TFT is woven into the fabric of powering and securing the entire network and is driven by an autonomous network layer for a secure, globally scalable, low cost, peer to peer, and inclusive internet. </p>
<p>ThreeFold Network is uniquely positioned to empower the cloud and blockchain markets, through use of ThreeFold's unvirsal internet capacity substrate (compute, storage and networking) to enable all IT work loads to scale to the edge of the network.</p>
<p>ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) are a decentralized digital currency used to buy autonomous and decentralized Internet services (compute, storage, applications) on the ThreeFold Network – generated only when active capacity is added to the ThreeFold Grid.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#tle-faq" id="tle-faq">TLE FAQ</a></h1>
<p><strong>What is a TLE?</strong>
A: An Token Listing Event (TLE) is a listing of the token market on an exchange. Token trading after the listing is available exclusively to the exchange's users. Token trading on a public exchange will allow anyone who needs ThreeFold Tokens in order to access ThreeFold Grid's capacity to purchase them.</p>
<p><strong>When is the start of the TLE?</strong>
The ThreeFold TLE date will be announced later. It depends on some preliminary milestones.</p>
<p><strong>What is the purchase price of the ThreeFold Token?</strong>
TFTs are priced at 0.15 USD per token on the TLE.</p>
<p><strong>Will registering to Liquid replace my wallet in the 3Bot Connect app?</strong>
No, registering on Liquid will make it possible to send and receive ThreeFold Tokens (amongst others) on the Liquid platform. In short you will have an extra wallet on the exchange from which you can trade the tokens.</p>
<p><strong>Why should I register for the TLE?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>To buy tokens when the TLE starts.</li>
<li>To trade ThreeFold Tokens when the TLE has ended.</li>
<li>To help ThreeFold reach their next milestones.</li>
<li>To go in and out of TFT's &gt; other currencies after the TLE.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Where can I register for the TLE?</strong>
You can register through <a href="https://www.liquid.com?affiliate=kmOSQysu714987">this link</a> for the TLE, make sure to follow the link when actually signing up to make sure you are using the ThreeFold referral code.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need to be verified to take part in the TLE?</strong>
Yes, to buy &amp; sell tokens on Liquid you will need to make sure you are verified. The means of verifying can differ depending on your country of origin or residence. To be 100% sure you are verified, it's best to reach out to Liquid by replying to the emails they sent you after registering.</p>
<p>**Is there anything else I need to do before I can take part in the TLE? ** 
Sign up for your account, set up 2FA and complete verification. After that, you’ll need to fund your account with either USD or USDC to take part in the ThreeFold Token (TFT) Sale. USD can be deposited by bank transfer or traded against BTC, ETH and other cryptocurrencies. USDC can be deposited or traded against BTC or ETH. The easiest way to get USDC is by using our Quick Exchange feature. Head to the sign-up page to get started. Enter your personal details and set up 2FA. Without Account Verification, you will qualify for a Basic Account which gives you access to many of Liquid’s core features. To take part in the ThreeFold Token sale, you will need to verify your account. With that done, you’re all set for the token sale. </p>
<p><strong>Is Liquid a Safe platform?</strong>
Yes, Liquid is safe and reputable platform that is regulated by the JSFA and audited by Deloitte. I has been ranked #1 by Coin Intelligence and #29 in Fintech 100 (2018).  If you would like to know more about the security measures taken by Liquid you can find more here: <a href="https://www.liquid.com/security/">https://www.liquid.com/security/</a></p>
<p><strong>Why is ThreeFold doing an TLE?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>To grow awareness about the ThreeFold project.</li>
<li>To scale-up our operations so we can reach our next milestones quicker.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How will the proceeds of the TLE be split up?</strong> 
5% will go to ThreeFold Foundation Operations
10% will go to Sponsorships for Impact Projects (e.g. education) 
20% will go to rants for grid projects (e.g. 3bot)
20% will go to tech Development
45% will go to awareness &amp; growth initiatives</p>
<p><strong>What Currencies can be used to buy ThreeFold Tokens during the TLE?</strong>
USDC , BTC, ETH, QASH and USD</p>

<p>Step 1. a farmer adds capacity to the grid. earns tokens for farming.</p>
<p>Step 2. farmer trades his TFT for fiat or other digital currencies</p>
<p>Step 3. a user buys TFT on an exchange</p>
<p>Step 4. a user reserves capacity with the TFT &gt; TFT’s from the transaction are distributed: farmer earns tokens for cultivation, a part goes to the foundation, a part gets burned.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#earning-tokens" id="earning-tokens">Earning Tokens</a></h1>
<p>The ThreeFold Token is developed in a way that it incentivizes the growth of the ThreeFold Grid. </p>
<p>Each farmer has two streams of TFT income:</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#farming" id="farming">Farming</a></h1>
<p><strong>PROOF-OF-CAPACITY</strong></p>
<p>When a person puts capacity on the ThreeFold Grid, this process is called Farming. To incentivize farming, the farmer will be remunerated a certain amount of tokens for doing so. </p>
<p>The number of tokens the farmer earns is dependent on multiple factors:</p>
<p>** Server/Node Specs of the Farmers Hardware**</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Compute Capacity (CPU)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Memory Capacity (RAM)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Storage Capacity (SSD/HDD)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These factors combine to a Cloud Production Rate (CPR). The higher the CPR, the more tokens are earned.</p>
<p><strong>Grid Specs (This is the same for all farmers at every point in time)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Farming Difficulty (the actual difficulty factor determining how fast TFT’s are created through farming)</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="header" href="#cultivation" id="cultivation">Cultivation</a></h1>
<p>Anyone can run applications and workloads on top of the ThreeFold Grid. Capacity can be reserved from the Farmer who has made this capacity available on the ThreeFold Grid. This payment for capacity will be made in ThreeFold Tokens. Cultivation incentivizes farmers to create capacity where it is needed most by rewarding them when that capacity is used.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#support-of-the-threefold-foundation" id="support-of-the-threefold-foundation">Support Of The Threefold Foundation</a></h1>
<p>In order to promote the growth and development of the ThreeFold Grid, a percentage of all cultivation transactions goes to the ThreeFold Foundation.</p>
<p>This percentage equals 10% at the moment. After 24 months of farming, it will go down to 5%.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#maximum-of-tokens-in-circulation" id="maximum-of-tokens-in-circulation">Maximum Of Tokens In Circulation</a></h1>

To make sure this TFT cap is adhered, the following mechanisms have been introduced:</a></h3>
<h2><a class="header" href="#burning" id="burning">Burning</a></h2>
<p>40-45% of the tokens for each Cultivation transaction will be burned. That means only the transactions where capacity users pay farmers for that capacity. Transactions that are made to other wallets, exchanges, etc are not subject to the burning of tokens.</p>
<p>E.g. a farmer asks 100 TFT for a certain amount of capacity + timeframe. The user of this capacity will pay the full 100 TFT. The farmer receives 50% of this amount, as 40-45% is burned off, and 10-5% of the transaction also goes to the ThreeFold Foundation.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#difficulty-level" id="difficulty-level">Difficulty level</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned in the farming section of this wiki entry, the amount of farmed tokens a Farmer receives when putting capacity online is subject to the difficulty level. This difficulty level is there to ensure there won’t be an oversupply of tokens nor capacity. The more ThreeFold Tokens exist, the fewer Tokens are distributed through Farming. The burning mechanism ensures the difficulty level does not stay at a level where it's not profitable to farm. </p>
<p><img src="docs/token/tokenomics//token/img/difficulty.png" alt="Difficulty level" /></p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#an-inclusive-market" id="an-inclusive-market">An Inclusive Market	</a></h1>
<p>The market for farming, cultivating and trading is open to all. If one has an internet connection and a power outlet he/she can become a Farmer, cultivate capacity and trade ThreeFold Tokens (TFT). Third party exchanges ensure that TFT can be exchanged between farmers and capacity users. </p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#the-valuation-of-the-grid" id="the-valuation-of-the-grid">The Valuation Of The Grid</a></h1>
<p>Each ThreeFold Token is tied to underlying capacity. The valuation of the total capacity of the ThreeFold Grid, gives an indication of the value of all ThreeFold Tokens in circulation. </p>
<p>To evaluate the storage and compute capacity of the ThreeFold Grid, we use very low pricing compared to other cloud offerings in the current market.</p>
<p>**Compute Unit (CU): 4 GB memory &amp; 2 virtual CPU **</p>
<pre><code>*  TF Simulation price = 8 USD

*  Market price = between 40 USD and 120 USD

<p>The ThreeFold system uses dispersed storage algorithms and is very different. The technology it uses was originally designed for communication in space. In a dispersed storage system the data gets dispersed in such a way that data will always be available even if 4 sites of the 20 (in this case) would not be available. Redundancy is the same as in the above example but the overhead is 20x less. It is also clear that security and efficiency is enhanced. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#how-is-this-space-algorithm-used-by-the-3bot" id="how-is-this-space-algorithm-used-by-the-3bot"><strong>How is this &quot;Space Algorithm&quot; used by the 3Bot</strong></a></h2>
<p>By nature, 3Bot is stateless (has no data storage of its own). 3Bot owns digital currencies (ThreeFold Token or TFT) that can be used to reserve raw storage and compute resources on the grid.</p>
<p><img src="docs/3bot/technology/../img/space.png" alt="image alt text" /></p>
<p>3Bots have unique capabilities to use CPU and storage capacities from different TF Nodes on the TF Grid safely and reliably. 3Bots can store a petabyte of information as long as TFTs are available to reserve the required capacity on the individual TF Nodes. Data cannot be lost because of the above described dispersed storage algorithm. A 3Bot is the only entity that has the required information and keys to retrieve the data it distributed.</p>

<p>Jumpscale is an automation framework written in Python. It has been developed for more than a decade and originates from an automation product that was acquired by SUN Microsystems from Q-Layer, which was one of our previous companies. Our newest release is version 10, called JSX.</p>
<p>Jumpscale is the foundation of the autonomous layer. To get to autonomous operations, IT experts have to model IT architectures. These models have to describe all the components involved in creating the architecture (e.g. a container running a webserver, a container running a database server, and then all the required network paths between these two containers and the rest of the world). Once this description is complete and tested, it can be given to the autonomous layer which launches, monitors, and operates the architecture by itself. Hence, autonomous IT.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#bcdb" id="bcdb">BCDB</a></h2>
<p>Our powerful Blockchain database.</p>
<p>The blockchain database has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Schemas (strongly typed)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3 types of indexing: key-based, full text search, and a full SQL compliant indexer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiple interfaces: REST, Redis, JavaScript client, GunJS, Python auto-generated client</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Large and small objects can be stored (MBs to bytes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All expected features from a blockchain are part of this product (e.g. immutability, verification, consensus, etc)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encryption of data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can guarantee full privacy for e.g. GDPR regulations (data is always 100% private, not shared)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ACLs = Access Control Lists</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multisignature</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For validation of new data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For an update of data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For invalidation (like delete, but data never really goes away – just becomes invalid)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Supported interfaces: WebDav, Redis, REST</p>
<p><img src="docs/3bot/technology/../img/bcbd.png" alt="image alt text" /></p>
<p>Depending on the type of required indexing, different support backend data storage or indexing systems will be used. The main supported backend storage device is Zero-DB. </p>

<p><img src="docs/3bot/technology/../img/retrieval.png" alt="image alt text" /></p>
<p>In the current Internet, retrieving information happens in two ways:</p>
<p><strong>Centralized</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Based on a URL (a unique resource locator), which is typically rather long</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A URL can only be used in a centralized context. It has been designed for that purpose. </p>
<ul>
<li>*Example URL: *<em>https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1555434992-f1670f5e8fce?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=934&amp;q=80</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Today +99% of all information is stored this way</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have to rely on the provider of the information (normally not the author) to deliver good uptime and enough connectivity to the Internet</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Distributed</strong></p>
<p>Blockchain or other distributed database</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A long key e.g. 32 characters, or even 64</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The data is distributed (sometimes replicated) over big areas – the data is not linked to the author but spread over a large area controlled by a blockchain or by a centralized application</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lookup process is typically slow – a special algorithm allows you to find the information in multiple steps, and there is no guarantee that the data is close to you when you need it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the suggested circular decentralized system there is only need for two numbers, to retrieve any information in the world. One number is to find which digital avatar to talk to, the other number is to find the information in the digital avatar of the data owner (can be human person or other legal entity).</p>
<p><img src="docs/3bot/technology/../img/distribution.png" alt="image alt text" /></p>
<p>Information can be a movie, for example, or a single piece of information like your email address. Each digital avatar is responsible for retrieving &amp; reconstructing the information from the underlying IT capacity network (the nodes on a decentralized internet). This happens in a very secure way and the digital avatar is the only digital entity capable of re-assembling the information in such a way it makes sense again. This leads to very strong security.</p>
<p><strong>With only two numbers any information in the world can be addressed.</strong></p>
<p>This way of how to address information has far-reaching implications and can change the way how the Internet works.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#indexing--search-problem" id="indexing--search-problem">Indexing &amp; Search Problem</a></h2>
<p><img src="docs/3bot/technology/../img/indexing-search.png" alt="image alt text" /></p>
<p>A difficult problem in a fully decentralized system is how to index and search for information.</p>
<p>When an author (in a company or private context) creates content, he or she needs to define access rights to one or more circles. If giving read access to the universe circle, it basically means everyone can retrieve the information. Each piece of information also needs labels – these are labels you freely choose and do not necessarily have a meaning outside of your own environment.</p>
<p>There are some automatic labels like type of document, creation date, or location of creation (e.g. photo).</p>
<p>An author can define which part of the document (if not all) is available for indexation.</p>
<p>In the TF Grid there are aggregation providers which are deployed (paid for) and owned by a specific 3Bot. These aggregation providers list themselves into the aggregator blockchain (BCDB).</p>
<p>Aggregator Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Big data analysis tool</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Company employee directory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AI tools</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>End user examples</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A football club directory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A city merchants organization</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each aggregator is basically a 3Bot who gets rights to query indexing and/or the information behind.</p>
<p>Each 3Bot (as instructed by their owners) needs to inform the required aggregators to index/access the information (in a broad sense: video, address details, documents, news as stored in the 3Bot. The 3Bot can use a combination of labels and circles to do so.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You create blog articles about food and want to be listed on an aggregator site of healthy food.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You found this aggregation site because of consulting the aggregator blockchain (of course there are nice tools available to make this user-friendly).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now instruct your 3Bot to list all your relevant blog articles with labels &quot;food&quot; &amp; “healthy” to that aggregator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The aggregator will now receive instructions to index the information and list it in its own application to the intended audience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The aggregator has the right to accept the information or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The aggregator can make a commercial business out of it and can decide to give part of the income to the original authors of the information using, for example, TFTs. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Important to note, the information itself does not get stored on the aggregator site, only when creating the index. The required index information is being provided and used to create the index. This means that sensitive information will stay on the author 3Bot, and only fields relevant for indexing will go to the aggregator.</p>
<p>This system is super scalable because aggregator sites by themselves are limited in scope and do pre-sorting of information people look for (e.g. an Uber alternative only makes sense in a certain region – there is no point to have a global Uber aggregation site). It's even possible to create aggregators of aggregator sites ie. Sites which make it easy to query information over multiple aggregators.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#this-leads-to-endless-scalability" id="this-leads-to-endless-scalability">This leads to endless scalability</a></h1>
<p>The above-suggested architecture scales endlessly. Millions of 3Bots = digital avatars can work with millions of nodes. The nodes provide the capacity, the digital avatars are the brain. There is no bottleneck in this architecture.</p>

<p>The big challenges for Information Technology today are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep IT systems safe, protect against hackers.  Hackers are everywhere and just like in the real world malicious people are are something of us.  In the digital world it can be identity, reputation, money and data.</li>
<li>Keep IT systems up &amp; running. we have become so reliant of IT systems to be up and runniong that we no longer can afford system crashes.  Imagine the controls of a power plant to no longer function and that this power plant is no longer abke to deliver power to the grid. </li>
<li>IT systems and mode importantly archietcture have not been designed to be power (and resource) efficient. The power usage of datacenters and all of its complicated conponents is crazy (not very sustainable).  The increased demand make this worse as there if much more focus to build new and additional capacity than there is to make existing capacity more efficient.</li>
<li>Data Privacy, Data Ownership and regulations put forwardward on this. Data is the new crude oil and it is everywhere therefore strong regulations are being put in place. </li>

<p>This project is one of the major use cases on the TF Grid.</p>
<p>3Bot is a revolutionary digital avatar that is designed to execute all of your digital needs. A definitive leap to true digital privacy, where only you can access your data, and no one else – not even us.</p>
<p>With 3Bot, free yourself from an app-centric system and enter a more secure, neutral, and decentralised digital world designed with you in the center. There will soon be no need for many applications on your device anymore.</p>
<p>3Bots manage and enable both the ThreeFold and FreeFlow Ecosystems. </p>
<p>To function properly and remain active on the TF Grid each 3Bot requires ThreeFold Grid capacity and thus ThreeFold Tokens.

<h1><a class="header" href="#about-the-company-1" id="about-the-company-1">About the company</a></h1>
<p>FlowGen is a dynamic company developing, producing and selling revolutionary small wind turbines. FlowGen is based in Zug ZG, Switzerland.</p>
<p>Instead of relying on conventional designs, we have designed our wind turbines from first principles, using the most advanced analytical tools available. In this way we have achieved performance levels previously thought impossible.</p>
<p>These performance levels allow us to create a new segment in the wind energy market.</p>
<p>Our Story
Founded by former Porsche GT3 race team leader Dirk Küster in 2010, FlowGen pushes the limits of optimisation in wind energy generation. Under the lead of Dirk, a team of experts from the motorsport aerodynamic area and the automotive industry have created a highly-efficient wind turbine by combining motorsport design tools and advanced aerodynamic know how. Formula 1 analysis tools and experience have been applied throughout the design and development process.</p>
<p>After the design milestones were achieved an automotive production process was conceived and developed with selected, internationally-renowned partners. The result is, a high volume, low cost mass production process which meets the needs of the market and allows us to offer a wind turbine that is practical to use and commercially attractive. To protect its unique concept, FlowGen holds a comprehensive portfolio of international patents as well as design and trademark rights relating the turbine and its parts.</p>
<p>But there are some things you can’t protect with patents. So, we maintain them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our excellent and motivated team</li>
<li>A solid network</li>
<li>Room for fresh visions</li>

<p>Today, global Internet and IT infrastructure require enormous amounts of energy far higher than the entire annual electricity consumption of the United Kingdom and it ranks among the most pollutive industries globally (similar to that of airlines).</p>
<p>We believe IT can do a lot better. In fact, we believe we can reduce the Internet’s carbon footprint drastically compared to other industry standard IT capacity producing solutions.</p>
<p>Power consumption is a function of better compute and storage performance requiring more racks and more cooling.</p>
<p>Our solutions achieve roughly 3 times the performance per rack (so we use fewer racks), and the racks require less energy than typical racks in the industry. </p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#less--more" id="less--more">Less = More</a></h3>
<h4><a class="header" href="#keep-it-simple" id="keep-it-simple">Keep it simple</a></h4>
<p>Over time, integration suites, middleware solutions, enterprise service busses have been invented and implemented to cover integration challenges. This has further complicated IT architectures and has resulted in loss of actual end user workload performance. By eliminating these layers of complexity, the resulting cloud stack presents minimal overhead and therefore requires less hardware which results in lower heat generation and eventually requiring less cooling. By producing less power, the net result is a total energy consumption decreases drastically. </p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#self-healing" id="self-healing">Self-Healing</a></h4>
<p>Keeping things up and running is a business model in modern day IT.  Major vendors earn most of their margin by selling maintenance contracts, performance guarantees, and professional services. Given their business model, there is little to no incentive to make things simple and efficient. Creating a self-healing environment requires minimal manual intervention to replace broken hardware components. Broken hardware components are inevitable, and the Zero-OS distributed node architecture deals with such failures by turning off broken components and provisioning unused capacity. Not having to ship broken parts back and forth together with the corresponding installation knowledge (engineers) means a much smaller carbon emission footprint.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#no-painkiller-approach" id="no-painkiller-approach">“No painkiller” approach</a></h4>
<p>If a specific piece of software or hardware is not delivering the required performance or reliability, we should analyze the core design/algorithm and its usage of soft/hard components to determine root causes of persistent issues and solve for that. Currently, most storage vendors follow the path of least resistance when trying to improve on performance, and their solution for meeting performance targets is to use faster components (CPU, memory, network card, proprietary acceleration) rather than looking at the core algorithms that drive the utilization of those components. Swapping components for faster ones perpetuates a cycle of cutting corners and focuses reliance on innovation from hardware component providers rather than solving the more fundamental and underlying issues.</p>
<p>By using these three principles, a Zero-OS node has a minimal power consumption footprint. Some key examples how this is achieved:</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#minimise-the-number-of-context-switches" id="minimise-the-number-of-context-switches">Minimise the number of context switches</a></h4>
<p>Virtualization adds a layer of software between the actual end-user workload and physical hardware, but it also allows for multiple workloads to run on the same hardware using excess capacity.  There is definitely merit in building a virtualization solution. Building an effective virtualization solution that does not require abundant context switching is key and is why Zero-OS has been developed.  Zero-OS uses a minimal linux kernel that allows for a number of user spaces to co-exist. In these user spaces, containerised versions of software can be run, taking away the need to have a hypervisor and a virtual OS fueling the virtual machines. This minimises the required overhead for the host OS and takes away the need for a hypervisor and guest operating systems.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#minimise-the-use-of-network-connections" id="minimise-the-use-of-network-connections">Minimise the use of network connections</a></h4>
<p>Supercomputing delivered a large number of new technologies. But, not all of the current ones are very usable solutions for everyday workloads. One technology invented to make supercomputers powerful (fast) is the use of Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA). RDMA allowed physical CPU boards (containing both CPUs and memory) to access other CPU boards in memory stored data over a dedicated channel. This eliminated the need to transport data between CPU nodes over network connections (or other mainstream means to exchange data). The result of this is that a lot less overhead was created to allow for distributed end user workloads to operate over multiple physical cores. The leading brands of server and storage solutions have never considered nor implemented such mechanisms which has increased the need for faster networks - increasing complexity, cost, effort and resources needed to operate the solution.</p>
<p>By using a different, more efficient means to exchange data between physical CPU units, we no longer require forests of switching gear.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#minimise-the-use-of-number-of-disks" id="minimise-the-use-of-number-of-disks">Minimise the use of number of disks</a></h4>
<p>The storage solution uses slow and big - the bigger the better - HDD disks which drive in rack density and as they spin slower they consume less power and need less cooling. How can you deal with read/write intensive workloads then? The storage algorithm uses a SSD cache to acknowledge I/O coming from the application, fills the erasure coded data blocks in large (up to 64MB) storage containers and writes these big chunks of data to the big and slow HHDs. If you are familiar with HDD disks, you know they like to be streamed on instead of a having a lot of small bits written to in scratchy way.</p>
<p>Continuous innovation in all of these areas have lead to a very efficient technology stack.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#anyone-is-able-to-deliver-capacity-to-the-threefold-grid" id="anyone-is-able-to-deliver-capacity-to-the-threefold-grid">Anyone is able to deliver capacity to the ThreeFold Grid.</a></h2>
<p><strong>In this article, we discuss the general concept of a ‘decentralized grid’.</strong></p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#decentralization" id="decentralization">Decentralization</a></h3>
<p>In 1989 the internet changed the world as we know it. The internet gave us more power to share information in a decentralized way. In turn, the blockchain now allows us to decentalize value, which could change the world further.</p>
<p>Companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon made big business out of the internet. The “sharing economy” has been growing over the last 5-10 years. This is thanks to a more simplified information flow and well-developed technology, which:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enables a much easier integration of independent players into the sharing economy.</li>
<li>Eliminates the need for extensive management and structure of a marketplace operators.</li>
</ol>
<p>We are at the dawn of a flat-structure economy. An economy where we need less managerial levels for the system to function in a good way.</p>
<p>Blockchain technology facilitates this ongoing trend. Participants can now interact on a peer-to-peer basis and form marketplaces and organizations according to pre-agreed, programmed contracts.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#the-internet-is-still-centralized" id="the-internet-is-still-centralized">The internet is still centralized</a></h3>
<p>Despite already seeing many examples of decentralized currencies, transportation, and ledgers we do not yet have decentralized datacenter technology, the very core of the internet as we know it.</p>
<p>To compete in the internet capacity market which is currently dominated by big IT companies, requires massive investment and IT development.</p>
<p>Over the last several years, ThreeFold has been developing decentralized datacenter technology that allows anyone to take part in the internet capacity market. Adding capacity to the ThreeFold Grid (TF Grid) makes you a ThreeFold Farmer (TF Farmer). </p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#how-to-become-a-threefold-farmer" id="how-to-become-a-threefold-farmer">How to become a ThreeFold Farmer</a></h3>
<p>The process of becoming a TF Farmer is very straightforward. Anyone can join the TF Grid by downloading the ThreeFold Zero-OS operating system onto nodes and connecting them to the ThreeFold network. By doing so you will be an operator of a &quot;micro datacenter&quot; and earn TF Tokens. Anyone can become a TF Farmer, no matter the level of experience. Which means you can become an ‘AirBnB’ TF Farmer of the new, neutral internet which belongs to us all of us.</p>
<p>Internet Capacity produced by a node is registered on the TF Directory. The TF Directory is a public directory of global purchasers of Internet Capacity. There is no need to build a marketing plan/department or to promote your available capacity.</p>
<p>Pricing is set by the TF Directory's algorithm based on numerous factors including real-time local supply and demand, competition, network connection, hardware type and the environment. TF Farmers are also allowed to set their own pricing.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#any-docker-service" id="any-docker-service">Any Docker Service</a></h2>
<p>TF-nodes run containers natively - therefore it can run any Docker service.  But it does so in a more efficient way than the current Docker engine - the most used and known container technology platform.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#iaas" id="iaas">IAAS</a></h3>
<p>The TF-node technology enables hardware capabilities to be used for IAAS services in a very efficient way.  Overhead is reduced to a minimum by stripping out unnecessary layers of software that have been implemented over the last decade to patch scaling and performance problems. Our engineers have always looked at the root cause of issues and by innovating at the core algorithm level solved issues. Examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Less is more</strong>: Scale down the operating system for a virtualisation architecture to a minimum and boot it over the network - no local operating system files installed on local storage.</li>
<li><strong>Look at root causes, do not invent painkillers</strong>: Step away from existing storage solutions that have a need for proprietary acceleration hardware and use standard off the shelf, affordable and efficient components with a 100% software based storage solution that is able to withstand hardware failures without requiring human intervention - creating a very efficient, reliable and performing storage solution that can operate standalone.</li>
</ul>
<p>The platform is secure by using a network boot mechanism making it virtually hack resistant because there are no operating system files installed locally.
Infrastructure as a service traditionally runs in hyperscale datacenters remote from the businesses using it. TF-node technology allows you to install, operate and run IAAS services close to your business locations operated by your local IT team.  It operates on a peer2peer network only transferring bits of data that need to be transported avoiding network congestion and traffic bottlenecks.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#archive" id="archive">Archive</a></h3>
<p>Data generation is growing exponentially. More data has been generated in the last 2 years than ever before. This data needs to be archived. The TF-node technology creates storage and archiving capabilities by using standard hardware and known interfaces will be build by developers wordwide and made available (S3, FTP, WebDav, CIFS and NFS).  The low levels storage functionality supports version controlling of the archived data which keeps all relevant changes without any limitation by using a small amount of actual storage capacity.</p>
<p>Data security and reliability are key aspects of any storage system.  The TF-node allows all data to be compressed and encrypted if and when needed. The distributed character of the storage system enables site redundant storage algorithms to be deployed keeping large data volumes from being stored in a single location taking away the risk of data being stolen (physically) and that of a site outage leading to a data outage.  The distributed character of the system is inline with the increasing spread of actual data generation.  We have sensory equipment everywhere these days and the overhead of storing all that information in a few central places is enormous  Data collection and storage happens once - reading data to use it for a particular workload happens many times.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#data-mining" id="data-mining">Data Mining</a></h3>
<p>On traditional server architectures, every application has to set up its own servers that run their own code in isolated silos, making sharing of data hard. The distributed character of the TF-node technology presents compute and storage capacity everywhere.  This enables large data mining workloads to happen close to the source of the data.  Data is stored in a distributed manner and therefore data mining can happen in a distributed manner as well. Distributed compute capacity next to storage capabilities creates the possibility to create data mining operations on local storage (which makes it very fast and efficient) by coding data mining algorithms in programming languages like python, lua, javascript and golang. Data mining follows distributed data storage.</p>
<p>Never run into scalability problems again - the TF-node data store can expand horizontally using thousands of distributed nodes to create large storage volumes.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#smart-contracts" id="smart-contracts">Smart Contracts</a></h3>
<p>Smart contracts are applications that run on a decentralised platform, exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference . These apps run on a blockchain, an enormously powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value around and represent the ownership of property. Smart contracts enable developers to create markets, store registries of debts (or promises), move funds in accordance with instructions given long in the past (like a will or a futures contract) and many other things without a middleman or counterparty risk.  TF-nodes run.</p>
<p>The TF-node technology natively supports the existing Ethereum network  and will have it's own way of running smart contracts by deploying a new blockchain technology, presenting a whole new approach on how to run  blockchain.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#self-learning--ai" id="self-learning--ai">Self Learning &amp; AI</a></h3>
<p>Blockchains can be seen as databases. By current database standards, traditional blockchains like Bitcoin are terrible: low throughput, low capacity, high latency, poor query support, and so on. But even with these terrible characteristics blockchains introduce three new and important characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decentralized data and shared data control.  Very simply said this leads to more data and qualitative better data which result in better models. Shortening the machine learning time and get AI progressing in a much faster pace.</li>
<li>Immutable audit trails improve the trustworthiness of the data &amp; models increasing provenance on training and testing results.</li>
<li>Native assets and  assets exchanges make  training and testing models intellectual property (IP) assets, which enhancing decentralized data &amp; model exchanges.</li>
</ul>
<p>Blockchain technology allows more data and with better quality to be presented to machine learning algorithms.  It has been proven (Microsoft researchers Banko and Brill) that more data — not just a bit more data but orders of magnitude more data — while  using same algorithms results in a lot better machine learning.  Meaning that the future of machine learning is not in trying to create more sophisticated algorithms (which will happen) .  So by moving AI learning into a blockchain environment we speed up machine learning and in the end create AI.</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#internet-capacity-needs-to-become-localized" id="internet-capacity-needs-to-become-localized">Internet capacity needs to become localized</a></h3>
<p>A big majority of users in the world connect to servers that are not present in their region and as such experience higher costs and low performance.</p>
<p>According to a study of <a href="http://www.datacentermap.com/">datacentermap.com</a> 80% of the datacenters of internet service providers are based in the U.S. and Europe. The rest of the world has scarce resources dotted around territories.</p>
<p>As a consequence most internet users use internet based services running on infrastructure which is located far away from their physical point of presence and most likely outside their country borders. This decreases the general end-user experience (latency) but also adds unnecessary costs for actually transporting information back and forth, and for enterprises it adds legislation and compliance headaches.</p>

<p>On a humanitarian level the opportunities for creativity, learning and development of new generations is influenced in a negative way by not having access to good, affordable internet services, keeping the status quo between the developed and less developed world. The United Nations have declared internet access a global <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/un-says-internet-access-is-a-human-right-2016-7?international=true&amp;r=US&amp;IR=T">human right</a>.

<h3><a class="header" href="#more-performance-required" id="more-performance-required">More performance required</a></h3>
<p>Compute &amp; Storage vendors create poor performing solutions. There have been year on year improvements of hardware following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore's law</a>. While this has allowed ThreeFold to progress and innovate it has also led to software developers taking these advances for granted; cutting corners where they can, creating sub-optimal code and allowing software components to be layered on top of each other to achieve certain functionality of behavior.</p>
<p>The inefficiencies have now led to a situation where organically grown IT architectures are immensely complex. They use a variety of components from different software and hardware vendors integrated by so called 'integrators'. The overall effort and cost involved to create, operate and maintain such architectures is growing continuously and requiring an ever increasing budget and resourcing to continue.</p>
<p>If we could go down to the core algorithms and take another look at these, innovate at the heart of technology instead of applying patches and pain killers, we would be able to create a lot more end-user capacity than what systems provide today. The result of this is that systems will last longer and will not have to be replaced by faster ones, it will take a lot less engineers to create, operate and maintain these systems and overall they will present a more stable and reliable platform achieving higher levels of uptime.</p>
<p>Only upsides, right? Well a huge downside of such an approach is that vendors will make less revenue and more importantly less margin as systems will run for longer, be more stable and require less updates. Why would vendors innovate at the core of their solution?</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#more-power-efficiency-required" id="more-power-efficiency-required">More power efficiency required</a></h3>
<p>Ten times more power efficiency can be achieved in e.g. storage systems</p>
<p>Today global Internet infrastructure requires enormous amounts of energy - well north of the entire annual electricity consumption of the United Kingdom - ranking among the more pollutive industries globally (similar to airlines!)</p>
<p>ThreeFold believes IT can do a lot better - in fact ThreeFold believes it can reduce the Internet’s carbon footprint by 10 times compared to other industry standard IT capacity producing solutions.</p>
<p>Power consumption is a function of better compute and storage performance requiring more racks and more cooling. The solutions achieve roughly 3 times the performance per rack (so it uses fewer racks) - and the racks require less energy than typical racks in the industry :-)</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#internet-capacity-is-expensive" id="internet-capacity-is-expensive">Internet capacity is expensive</a></h3>
<p>The biggest cost of running IT architectures is people.</p>
<p>Today's complex, built out of ‘band aid and patches’ point solutions, organically grown and badly documented IT infrastructures need an armada of people to keep it ticking. Find an example IT budget <a href="http://www.gartner.com/downloads/public/explore/metricsAndTools/ITBudget_Sample_2012.pdf">here</a>. Even though this is an example budget one can learn a lot from the trends that are presented in the example:</p>
<ul>
<li>On average an IT budget takes 5% of overall revenues</li>
<li>IT consumes 6.5% of the total number of FTE in the company of which 85% are insource and 15% is on payroll. This means that the enterprise doesn't retain internal know-how to operate their IT.</li>
<li>Just under 50% of the IT budget is spent on Infrastructure and operations and a similar amount is spent on applications. A mere 5% is considered to be internal overhead within the IT department.</li>
<li>Around 65% of the IT budget is spent on resources and services, around 35% is spent on hardware and software.</li>
</ul>
<p>These figures present industry average numbers and paint a troubling picture that IT is a sizeable part of an overall budget, and that most spending is going to have the right knowledge skills insourced to the organisation to run the core IT architecture on which the whole company operations rely - for any other discipline in any organisation this would present an unacceptable risk to the business and it's continuity - strangely not for IT.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#people-are-a-source-of-downtime-we-need-more-intelligence" id="people-are-a-source-of-downtime-we-need-more-intelligence">People are a source of downtime, we need more intelligence</a></h3>
<p>The biggest source of downtime in computer systems are people.</p>
<p>Getting people involved in fixing infrastructure problems creates the risk of accidentally causing more system downtime. A very recent example on this hit a large <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/message/41926/">organisation</a> providing cloud services.</p>
<p>20+ years ago when internet datacenters came into existence next to telecom points of presence (POP'’) the level of complication in architecting, building and maintaining these infrastructures exploded. From an already reasonable complicated technology setup to transport packets of data around the globe, these information warehouses were created where data was uploaded to, processed and the obtained results sent back to end users often many hundreds of kilometers away.</p>
<p>Managing a datacenter that contains solutions for transporting information, for storing information and to process information is not an easy feat and the growth of data volume uploaded, stored and processed has exponentially increased. The number of technologies invented and implemented processing and storing this information has also exploded which as a combination results in a double exponential growth in complexity to architect, build, operate and maintain these.</p>
<p>The time has come that we no longer rely on people to do the right thing in case of emergency - the complexity is overwhelming and the dependency on this information being available is huge. Manual deployments and operational responsibility by people is not providing the agility and speed to keep up with the continuous exponential growth of the industry. It is time to take the human element out of Information Technology and let smart systems take over.</p>

<p>The current growth of internet needs 4000+ new large scale data centers of computer systems.</p>
<p>The global data growth will reach more than 40 Zetabytes by 2020 which represents an average year over year growth from 42% starting at 4.5 Zetabytes in 2013*. To host all this data over 4000 new big data centers need to be built. To achieve this goal, $ 1 trillion USD investment capital is needed and land totalling the size of the UK would be needed <a href="https://www.siemens.com/innovation/en/home/innovation-strategy/driving-forward-digitalization.html">e.g. siemens innovation strategy</a>.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#the-magical-zero-node" id="the-magical-zero-node">The Magical Zero-Node</a></h1>
<p>The guiding design principle is that simpler solutions increase efficiency and productivity. </p>
<p>Less = More</p>
<p>The Zero-OS (Stateless Operating System) node technology is based on technology that has been developed and innovated for 15 years in an incubation center. Mid to late 90’s some were working for a large American firm that was investing in creating Europe’s first large scale (internet) datacenters and internet connectivity.  In that period 5 major datacenters were built and put into production. It became frustrating to see the amount of money, time and energy required to architect, install, operate and maintain complex IT infrastructures. It was a very passionate time where better technology was created which addresses these issues.</p>
<p>To build a technology stack from point solutions from A-brand vendors requires a tremendous amount of integration software,equipment and knowledge / human resource effort.  The result is a very complicated operational setup that costs a lot of money, uses a lot of power and requires a large amount of maintenance contracts and engineers.</p>
<p>This inspired us to create more effective IT architectures powering IT workloads without all the complexity and unnecessary components by starting an incubation center to specifically develop technologies creating more efficient ways of doing very standard things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use more of the available compute power by virtualisation technologies allowing multiple tenants to use one physical machine.</li>
<li>Create a performing and reliable storage solution by using standard off the shelf components and staying as far away as possibly from proprietary hard- and software to enhance storage performance.</li>
<li>Create a low level power management device that is able to manage and monitor the whole upstream power feed and creates efficient power consumption.  One of the key aspects of this technology is that it measures Voltage and Amperage 25k times a second, which provides very detailed information about how the power supply is “consuming” energy  and allows for analytical failure prediction.</li>
</ul>
<p>A Zero-Node consists of hardware and software. A Zero Node can be purchased from the TF Foundation or by downloading and installing software on existing re-purposed hardware.</p>

<p>There are advantages in building large scale data centers, like economies of scale and shear bulk buying power compared to small ones, but these are not as big as people think. The average cost per rack in a hyper scale data center is $20-35K USD including all energy and safety systems. The cost of the hardware per rack is around the $200-300K USD mark.</p>
<p>What is often forgotten is that anything that is of enormous scale and therefore highly concentrated is complex and has a specific set of problems to deal with. Resource requirements for example, such as investment, operational costs, knowledge and people.</p>
<p>In reality keeping things simple and small is much more cost effective than a big complex environment.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#myth-2-big-data-centers-can-be-made-green" id="myth-2-big-data-centers-can-be-made-green">Myth 2: Big data centers can be made green.</a></h3>
<p>The carbon footprint of a big datacenter is enormous. To improve the PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) most data center farmers have adopted wind, hydro and/or solar power technologies, which indeed helps drop their PUE by an estimated 20%.</p>
<p>This 20% looks great on paper and in the farmers' corporate social responsibility reports. It is mostly, however, just an improvement on the cooling technology, not the actual energy consumed by the equipment that runs in their data centers (servers, storage chassis, physical disks, etc) and this equipment is what makes up the 100% of the carbon footprint. PUE only refers to overhead power consumption, i.e. cooling the facility, opening and closing doors, maintaining power security systems, etc.</p>
<p>So real improvement lies in deploying technologies that actually consume less power to deliver the actual Internet IT capacity to run workloads, real CPU chassis, physical disks and storage cabinets. Improving on how hardware is being more effectively used can have an impact of 1000% and lead to 10 times more power efficiency.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#myth-3-redundant-systems-have-a-better-uptime" id="myth-3-redundant-systems-have-a-better-uptime">Myth 3: Redundant systems have a better uptime.</a></h3>
<p>A lot of us believe that systems need redundancy mechanisms to improve their operational uptime and reliability. To be honest if you look at it (through IT tainted glasses) for a moment this seems to make a lot of sense. But what if we translate this to the non-IT world?</p>
<p>To make a car more reliable we add redundancy (as we do in IT). So for the risk of having a puncture we add one extra tire for all the tires we use continuously. This adds 4 extra tires to the car. Then a decision needs to be made: Do we put those tires in a structure where they are always running along the primary tires or do we chose not to have them &quot;on line&quot; all the time, wearing and tearing in the same way as the primary tires?</p>
<p>Building such a system would take a large number of engineers come up with a solution, and would change cars as we know them. Would it not make more sense to think outside the box and solve the root of the problem by making tires un-deflatable?</p>
<p>The IT industry has gone overboard  with the concept of redundancy, having forgotten to look  at the root cause issues. This has spawned a whole new industry of itself, which has a financial interest in creating complicated and expensive redundant system.</p>

<p>At first glance this sounds logical, but if we look at the IT landscape today 90%+ of innovation in IT is done by small startups. The big legacy IT companies have a heritage they hardly can overcome. They are locked in old infrastructure designs, and over time to building outside of that infrastructure is to put the breaks on their business.</p>
<p>Real innovation dies a slow death and gives way to fix the symptom rather than the problem pain-killer approach.</p>

<p><img src="docs/blog/img/the_need_for_new.jpg" alt="Logo" /></p>
<p><strong>The internet is growing like crazy. This is a Trillion Dollar problem.</strong>
<BR>
<strong>Together we can build a new internet.</strong></p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-problem-1" id="the-problem-1">The Problem</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Internet is no longer the neutral place it used to be. 80+% of Internet capacity is delivered by a handful of companies. This results in loss of neutrality and openness and breeds inequality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To support the continuous growth of the Internet and connect billions of new Internet Of Things devices, 400 million new servers are needed by 2020. The world needs another 4,000 large- scale data centers that each consume 200 MWe of electricity: <a href="http://bit.ly/1UPUZYG">see source</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bandwidth does not follow Moore’s law. The growth of bandwidth required is much higher than the speed at which new capacity can be delivered.This is even more important in emerging markets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Today, 3.2 billion people have no access to Internet due to the high costs of connectivity and capacity. We believe these people have the fundamental right to have low-cost access to digital resources like online education, health information, social media and online communities ...
Solutions which can lower the cost by a factor of 10 are required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Current blockchain technology is not scalable and not green. Example: the Bitcoin blockchain alone uses more energy today than Croatia.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#internet-capacity-today--the-cloud" id="internet-capacity-today--the-cloud">Internet Capacity Today = The Cloud</a></h2>
<p>Today cloud computing is a $100+ billion industry - mostly owned by 20 or so global cooperations. Experts such as Bell Labs and Cisco believe the capacity requirement in the next decade will dramatically outstrip existing infrastructure - requiring an additional 400m servers - or approximately 4000 hyperscale datacenters - at a cost of $250 mio to $1 bn each.</p>
<p>The spectacular growth and advances of cloud computing that occurred over the last decade resulted in large part from “hyper-scale” efficiencies - ie centralising Internet infrastructure in very large $ billion data centers.  Today demand for Internet capacity already outstripping the available infrastructure due to new applications like Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT) and Self Healing Technology.  The existing hyperscale cloud architecture cannot cope with this outsize demand as the requirements for land, power and funding are just too great.</p>
<p>The challenges facing the Internet include the following::</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>$ Trillions of Investment Required.  In the next decade, the global internet infrastructure requires another 4,000 data centers (250M$ - $1bn+ each) to meet demand which would cost $ trillions - an impossible amount of money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impossible to scale the network connecting users to the hyperscale data centers.  Since Hyperscale data centers are built in large central locations, the network leading to these data centers is congested.  Even more, remote regions that are less connected to the internet cannot benefit from the data centers’ IT services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-Local data and capacity.  Governments around the world are becoming more and more concerned about data leaving their borders - these governments require IT infrastructure to be local.  Furthermore, IoT workloads require local capacity to deliver constant real time computing and storage requirements - for certain applications and workloads (eg driverless cars), latency is not an option.   Hyperscale Data centers can simply not deliver to these requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-secure / at risk of choke point failures.  There are plenty of recent well publicized problems with security, outages and lost data.  The reason for this is that centralised hyperscale architectures are inherently insecure - and failures at a single hyperscale location can cause widespread contagion and outages.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-threefold-solution" id="the-threefold-solution">The ThreeFold Solution</a></h2>
<p>Our solution to these $trillion problems is to migrate Internet IT capacity to the Edge - ie a “hyper-distributed” network architecture, located close to users (in cities, schools, offices, homes and even vehicles).</p>
<p>Edge networks will not necessarily replace the existing hyperscale capacity powering today’s cloud - rather, Edge networks will scale to meet the increased capacity demands going forward.</p>
<p>By 2025 60% of new internet infrastructure will be decentralized and located at the edge of the operator networks, using alternative locations which have stable (renewable) power and reliable connectivity.</p>
<p>The ThreeFold solution has following main benefits:</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#secure" id="secure">Secure</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The Grid is distributed and benefits from our ItsYou.Online identity management platform - making it much more secure</li>

<li>The technology avoids having to build huge power hungry datacenters (we are 10x more green).</li>
<li>The solution brings capacity where the consumers are = Cloud At The Edge</li>
<li>We make IT a true utility = IT As Energy (3x more uptime, 3-10x more cost effective)</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="header" href="#neutral" id="neutral">Neutral</a></h3>

<p>ThreeFold technology breaks with the traditional IT model. The Edge internet needs a different approach.</p>
<p>ThreeFold's open-source tech addresses the scalability, security, storage, energy and operating issues - by simplifying architectures and not relying on third party software. This drives down costs and improves efficiencies.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#what-is-our-technology-toolbox" id="what-is-our-technology-toolbox">What is our Technology Toolbox?</a></h3>
<p>TF technology is based on three primary building blocks:  Stateless Computing, Self-Healing Technology and Blockchain technology - this is the core of our “Technology Toolbox&quot;.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Stateless Computing: a stateless operating system, Zero-OS, enabling distributed hardware to form an Edge Internet grid generating IT storage and compute capacity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Self-Healing Technology controls and operates a distributed cloud and reserves, procures and executes workloads on the grid using our Jumpscale platform. It delivers autoscaling and automation frameworks that enable self-healing and can be adapted for any kind of IT workload.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blockchain Technology, via Rivine.io,  our secure, scalable “proof of stake” blockchain, along with our identity management platform, ItsYou.online. Our blockchain technology enables user authentication, access controls, secure workloads and heightened security.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#why-stateless-computing" id="why-stateless-computing">Why Stateless Computing?</a></h2>
<p>The global Edge internet will be composed of thousands (millions?) of nodes distributed geographically.  This means the Edge internet must be powered by a stateless operating system that can be booted via the Internet (as opposed to living on the node locally). This removes the complexity of upgrades, truck rolls, etc</p>
<p>Open-source components have been developed, Zero-OS,for the deployment of bare metal machines functioning as Internet nodes and application hosts.  Our Zero-OS platform runs containerized applications and software code on secure and distributed IT infrastructure.  Zero-OS can be deployed on off-the-shelf hardware by anyone that is willing to make server and storage capacity available in their markets and within our network</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#the-benefits-of-stateless-computing-are-substantial-including" id="the-benefits-of-stateless-computing-are-substantial-including">The benefits of Stateless Computing are substantial, including:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Performance: lightweight OS without overhead for running bare-metal machines</li>
<li>Free: finds the optimal performance of server &amp; storage nodes at no cost</li>
<li>Private: no data footprint remains while workloads move from one node to another</li>
<li>Distributed: capacity is generated without the need for datacenters: At The Edge</li>
<li>High-available: easy creation of clusters while applications run in fragmented segments</li>
<li>Portability: moving software from one node to another within the grid is instant</li>
<li>Secure: open-source distributed software with transparent code. No security backdoors</li>
<li>Green: energy-efficient OS resulting in very low node power consumption.</li>
</ul>

<p>Jumpscale framework and ZeroRobot allow the creation of blueprints to auto-deploy applications within the compute environment.</p>
<p>Our robots are constantly checking the health and uptime of the infrastructure and runtime environments, guaranteeing performance &amp; availability of applications.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#the-benefits-of-our-self-healing-technology-protocols-include-the-following" id="the-benefits-of-our-self-healing-technology-protocols-include-the-following">The benefits of our Self-Healing Technology protocols include the following:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Self-Healing: the platform regenerates when health issues are detected that cause downtime for infrastructure and applications</li>
<li>Intelligence: agents capture information from the grid and make intelligent decisions to provide an ideal and optimal host environment for software code and containerized applications</li>
<li>Lifecycle Management: the status of the infrastructure and the lifecycle of running applications are constantly checked and recorded</li>
<li>Autoscaling: the platform automatically scales to meet application and infrastructure performance.</li>

<p>Unlike the “proof of work” blockchains that currently dominate the space, our Rivine.io blockchain is scalable, green and secure - and does not rely on huge mining resources.  We run our blockchain on approximately 200 dedicated nodes and do not rely on any third party software</p>
<p>In addition to our blockchain technology, we have also developed itsyou.online, identity and access management platform.  Itsyou.online uses three factor authentication to manage access on our network and facilitate execution</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#the-world-needs-a-new-stable--green-digital-currency-which-is-usable-globally" id="the-world-needs-a-new-stable--green-digital-currency-which-is-usable-globally">The world needs a new stable &amp; green digital currency, which is usable globally.</a></h2>
<p>Digital currencies are well on the way to full acceptance as a mainstream currency. Today, there are approximately US$ 130+ billion of digital currencies in circulation and approximately US$ 1 billion traded daily on a host of open market exchanges.  Benefits of digital currencies include direct peer to peer transactions (requiring no intermediaries such as banks); greater trust (secured by cryptography and mathematics); lower friction charges; faster transaction times and no single point of failure.</p>
<p>However, major problems remain such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of scalability.  The main blockchains today are based on “proof of work” - generating very large and complex prime numbers called “hashes” to record ledger transactions.  These proof of work blockchains can not scale to meet the increasing blockchain transaction volumes.  In fact, Ethereum, one of the most popular and well known blockchains has announced it will change from “proof of work” to “proof of stake”</li>
<li>Impossible energy requirements. Computing complex proof of work hashes requires enormous amounts of processing power.  In fact a large portion of today’s hashrate is produced by very large dedicated $ billion data centers called miners.  It is estimated that the energy consumed by digital currency mining is approximately equivalent to the power consumption of the entire country of Denmark.</li>
<li>Certain perceived reputational issues.  Numerous commentators - particularly in the early years of bitcoin - speculated that unregulated digital currencies could be used to fund illicit activities.</li>
<li>A general absence of intrinsic value.  The major digital currencies today are not backed by real assets</li>
<li>Limited utility.  Today digital currencies are predominantly held by miners and investors.  There is very limited use of digital currencies to buy goods and services.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="docs/blog/img/escape.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Have you seen ‘The Great Hack’ on Netflix? It’s a documentary about the Cambridge Analytica hacking scandal, where personal data of millions of peoples’ Facebook profiles were harvested without their consent and used for political advertising purposes. </p>
<p>While watching it, I couldn’t help but think how unfair it is that in today’s digital society, people are being treated like products, because there is no such thing as a ‘free’ platform without YOU being the product. What did reassure me, is that people are sick of having their data used this way. But what they might not know, is that the internet problem is bigger than ‘just’ data protection.</p>
<p>The Internet is growing at an exponential rate. To service this demand, a few large companies (Google, Amazon, Alibaba, Facebook, etc.) have built and continue to build supersized, power-hungry and centralized data centers. These data centers make up the majority of all Internet capacity available today. However, the Internet is expanding much faster than datacenters and the planet can cope with. </p>
<p>In addition to that, the Internet is extremely centralized, with most of these data centers being located in the US. Think of it like electricity. If consumers in, for example, Turkey had to use electricity generated in the US, it would be too expensive and inefficient, because it is too far away. The transmission lines would be too strained and losses and repairs would make it unsustainable. Capacity is like electricity. When centralized, it becomes too expensive and wasteful for remote users.</p>
<p>So what is the solution to these problems? </p>
<p>The Internet needs to be more distributed, cost-effective, neutral, and sustainable. ThreeFold has developed such a new technology, the ThreeFold Grid (Grid) and a token which enables all this to happen.</p>
<p>Combining the values of the ThreeFold Foundation (freedom, equality and fairness) with the technology developed by TF Tech (Zero-OS, Zero-Chain, 3Bot) and a digital currency called the ThreeFold Token (a decentralized digital currency and means of payment to exchange autonomous and decentralized Internet services)  we believe that we have all the tools in order to actually make a difference in tomorrow's digital world.

<p>During a gathering with some friends, I noticed something that made me think about how important it is what we’re doing. </p>
<p>One of my friends was complaining about how he couldn’t log in to one of his social media platforms, because all of his passwords are different and he forgot which one he used for this particular platform. Another friend was saying how she tagged her sister on a funny meme, but her sister couldn’t find it on Facebook. Turns out she tagged her on Instagram. And then one of them said something that I keep hearing more and more from people, “Why do we have so many apps, I can’t find anything anymore!” </p>
<p>We exist so many times online, but why? There is only one me in the real world. Why should there not be only one me online? Why should I have 25 different profiles on 25 different platforms, with 25 different logins, when I am unique? </p>
<p>That is another dilemma that the ThreeFold Network has a solution for. The 3Bot. A digital avatar like no other, that basically handles your entire online life. The focus lies on digital privacy, where only you can access your data, and no one else. The 3Bot has all the functionalities you need to interact and exchange information and value, there will be no need for that many applications on your device anymore. With 3Bot, everything changes. </p>
<p>The 3Bot is built on the ThreeFold Grid, and has the same values as the ThreeFold Network. Freedom, Equality, and Fairness. It is important that your data is safe, and what can be safer than you being the only one who not only has access to it, but also the only one who owns that data? Your online world should not be that different from your offline world. In your offline world, you are the center of your own life. That is what the ThreeFold Network is doing with the 3Bot, putting you in the center of your online life too. </p>

<p><img src="docs/press/img/mou.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>18 October 2018</p>
<p><strong>Dubai, UAE</strong>: Today at GITEX Technology Week, ThreeFold signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to cooperate in the CEEMA region on the implementation of a decentralized grid of computing and storage capacity, which enables a neutral, low cost and low energy internet on a global scale. </p>
<p>HPE provides their clients in the CEEMA region with the option to connect their computing and storage capacity to ThreeFold’s decentralized grid that supports ThreeFold’s mission to provide a Responsible Internet, accessible to all.</p>
<p>HPE server and storage hardware has been certified to be used on ThreeFold’s Grid and HPE plans to build services to support the growth and usage of ThreeFold’s Grid which is in line with their edge cloud and blockchain strategy.</p>
<p>ThreeFold launched a Responsible Internet capacity platform (on March 2018) with the support and collaboration from its community, and has already achieved sizable deployments of decentralized internet compute and storage capacity across the globe. ThreeFold’s open source and localized IT capacity encourage developers; as a result of cost and performance efficiencies, to build all types of decentralized applications on its network to promote the expansion of a new digital responsible economy. </p>

<p>Stories help us to organise our work. They need to comply with specific requirements to be effective.</p>
<p>A story normally represents the view of a person, e.g. &quot;I as product owner for product X would like to see Y features to be implemented because... customer Z needs this... our strategy is...&quot;</p>
<p>Writing user stories may seem to be simple, but it requires attention. Common mistakes include creating stories that are incomplete, inconsistent or missing valuable parts such ass acceptance criteria/DOD. To avoid this common mistakes, we have created this list of the most common pitfalls you must avoid while creating your stories.  <a href="docs/collaboration//collaboration/story_pitfalls.html">See the story pitfalls</a></p>
<p>Stories are pieces of work (not simple tasks) which are aggregated in a story = its like a card you would stick on a whiteboard.</p>
<p>Stories are the cards as used in our circles tool (circles.threefold.me)</p>

<li>We cannot achieve our goals without friends who are willing to use their money to help us to achieve our goals. We need to have respect for their funding and do everything we can to provide a good return on investment, which is of course very fair and normal.</li>
<li>We believe its also important to look for investors who believe in our values.</li>
<li>We need to make sure that every $ is used to its utmost potential, this is much more easily said than done.

<li>HR: always make sure that people provide the right level of contribution in line with their salary.</li>

<h1><a class="header" href="#intro" id="intro">Intro</a></h1>
<p>I am sure many people will think &quot;who is this guy&quot; what gives him the right to write about values, allow me to explain my motivations.</p>
<p>I have been very fortunate to meet my wife Isabelle who has been very sick and by helping her to get better I met a lot of wonderful people, who showed me a new path. I've met people who were close to dying but they had more courage, love and determination to survive than I have ever seen. Most of these people miraculously made it. This got me to rethink my belief system. I was doing something wrong, what were my values, where did I lose my path.</p>
<p>They showed me that by becoming more <strong>aware</strong> I could become a better person and entrepreneur. I have been (still am) a very stubborn person not always listening to a lot of coaches/friends who were trying to show me the way, I am grateful to all of them and maybe their efforts start paying off.</p>
<p>Writing this document is an exercise in writing down what is important to me and perhaps even have an impact on the startups I am involved with.</p>
<p>I (and I hope by now many people together with me) have this big dream about trying to build a new neutral internet and who knows maybe even a new stable non speculative currency. These are super ambitious goals and together with more and more friends we try to accomplish it.</p>
<p>I feel this will only be possible if we dare to be different, if we dare to embrace other ways of thinking, if we dare to trust and lose our ego &amp; fear. Our partners &amp; customers need to believe in the same values.</p>
<p>This is not just a &quot;hippy&quot; thought, I am 100% sure that the world is changing quickly and more and more people want to leave the current path of hate, fear &amp; greed.</p>
<p>Around mid 2016 also I was afraid, too focussed on negative energies in the world, everything which can go wrong, war, global warming, ... This doesn't mean I am now ignoring these negative forces but I've learned by being focussed on positive energy we all together create a better alternative. For every negative there is an as strong positive, so by growing the positive we can eventually make the world a better place. Its also more fun to do. </p>
<p>I've seen over the last months how this way of thinking is very contagious. We have met wonderful people and through them even more wonderful people, it's going quite fast right now. This is a great feeling and I cannot express enough my gratitude to everyone who dares to share our values and build a better place together with us. </p>
<p>Every day I am still fighting my own daemons like fear, ego, sometimes even anger... but by acknowledging them and trying to follow our values I am trying to beat them and to have a positive impact. The ONLY way for us to accomplish our goals is by keep on growing ourselves and hope that other people follow this example.</p>
<p>I can only hope that some of you reading this document, see value in our &quot;values&quot; and are willing to help and together create a better more human, respectful world.</p>
<p>Last but not least I would like to thank my friends who are showing me the way, who believe in what we do and who trust in our good cause and often do a better job in maintaining our values than I do.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#our-5-core-values" id="our-5-core-values">Our 5 core values.</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#grow--give-energy" id="grow--give-energy">Grow &amp; Give Energy</a></h2>
<p>&quot;Energy&quot; is a subtle but strong force which is behind anything happening in our world.
Everyone is capable of channeling &amp; delivering energy.
Yes, this sounds abstract and maybe not something which resonates with you at this point.
But this &quot;Energy&quot; is an amazing source of creativity, happiness, motivation, success, ...
If you learn how to harness this energy your personal as well as your professional life will thrive. </p>
<p>Some describe this as &quot;vibration&quot;, how higher you vibrate how more energy you will deliver but also you will attract people which also vibrate at higher frequencies it's a self enforcing circle.</p>
<p>Everyone is on their own path towards a higher vibration but to recognize this fact and to try to positively contribute to this will enrich your and your colleagues lives.</p>
<p>It takes some courage to admit that you acknowledge or even better agree with this section (-:</p>
<p>Some tips which I found useful</p>
<ul>
<li>be a positive influencer in any conversation, never go negative</li>
<li>have respect for capabilities &amp; strengths of people. Don't focus on limitations or shortcomings.</li>
<li>glass = half full</li>
<li>negativity, sarcasm, anger are all negative emotions and need to be avoided
<ul>
<li>if you feel someone is going there explain what you have noticed in a non threatening way and what this does to you</li>
<li>this takes some courage but you will see immediate impact on the energy levels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>believe in our common goals, be a believer, don't be naive either but in case you see issues explain in a positive way</li>
<li>see when someone is taking energy, DO NOT ACCEPT THIS</li>
<li>if you need to evaluate new colleagues, try to sense their level of positive energy, do not go for someone who takes energy, talk about it though, explain why this is important to you/us.</li>
<li>we are human, we will make mistakes to this all the time, recognize them and go back to relevant people to apologise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Out of my own experience, acknowledging that this <strong>Energy Thing</strong> exists and is important and try to improve your own <strong>awareness</strong> will prove to be very fulfilling and make your life and life of people around you more rich.</p>
<p>Dare to trust your intuition, it's a very strong tool, and we all have it but we are too afraid to use it.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#tame-your-ego--fear" id="tame-your-ego--fear">Tame your Ego &amp; Fear.</a></h2>
<p>All of us are born 100% innocent, connected to the universe.
As we grow up we are imprinted by our environment and we will grow our own &quot;ego&quot; starting from puberty. We need to realize that this <strong>brainwashing</strong> (-: has its long lasting effect on our future.</p>
<p>Ego drives many and can lead to success but the ones who manage to &quot;tame&quot; their ego will be much more successful and for sure live more happily.</p>
<p>Close to &quot;ego&quot; lives &quot;fear&quot;, unfortunately today many (governments, companies, people) use fear to steer people in a certain thought direction, often <strong>people bring fear to others as a reaction on their own fear</strong>.</p>
<p>Fighting our fear and have confidence in the future is magical. Its very hard and a constant struggle.</p>
<p>Fear today is part of our society, this is sad and is something we need to fight</p>
<p>some examples what was thought to us (wrongly)</p>
<ul>
<li>you need to study harder or you will fail in life (even if it means doing something against your skills &amp; wishes)</li>
<li>you need money to be respected, survive, money is everything</li>
<li>status is everything, publicity/movies it's all about ego driven greed</li>
<li>if you are not successful you won't find the right friends (wife?)</li>
<li>we want a big house to show others that we are &quot;important&quot;. We hope that people will like us more if we do so.</li>
<li>people will laugh with you and won't like you if you don't perform well (e.g. a performance or a speech)</li>
<li>&quot;the russians&quot; will kill us, oh no, now it is, &quot;the muslim terrorists&quot; will destroy us</li>
<li>we are thought don't trust others, they can hurt you, it's better to distrust</li>
</ul>
<p>in a business context</p>
<ul>
<li>we are thought to create complex contracts to protect us, out of fear really</li>
<li>we aren't ready with our product yet, let's not tell because otherwise they won't buy</li>
<li>we something thing a small lie is ok, because it serves our bigger purpose, e.g. because otherwise we won't get the required funding</li>
<li>we need to do a lot of marketing, to pretend we are bigger than we are</li>
<li>the usage of hollow words, to let us sound big (we are leading, world bla bla company...)</li>
<li>trying to get known to people not out of business need but rather for our own &quot;ego&quot;, see what we can do, see how successful we are.</li>
<li>we need to put a lot of security on our file server because our employees will steal from us or abuse information.</li>
<li>let’s not share this info with our customers, they should' have to know...</li>
<li>let's pay some hidden commission because this is how it works in this country...</li>
<li>let's abuse contracts or patents as a business practice and even pretend that this is ok</li>
</ul>
<p>In my opinion all above are <strong>lies</strong>. We need to <strong>unbrainwash</strong> ourselves.</p>
<p>There are more elegant ways how to deal with possible issues starting from <strong>positive energy</strong>, use</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>trust</strong></em>: trust your customer to do the right thing</li>
<li><em><strong>transparency &amp; openness</strong></em>: access to information e.g. show cost prices</li>
<li><em><strong>communicate</strong></em>: dare to share mistakes</li>
<li><em><strong>kis</strong></em>: keep things simple, e.g. easy clear contracts, easy pricing schemes, ...</li>
<li><em><strong>show others the way</strong></em>: many want to do live this way, people are getting sick of lies.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 4 last ones mean you need to trust your partner or customer. What do you have to lose? Even the most complex contract cannot protect you if your trust relationship has been broken, together you will no longer be successful.</p>
<p>We shouldn't be naive though and be careful in selection of our partners &amp; customers.
Just like we look for our positive energy colleagues we need to evaluation our customers &amp; partners in the same way. Do they follow our values, can we trust them!!!</p>
<p><strong>Follow your instinct</strong> it's much more powerful than you think.</p>
<p>Now many of you will be thinking, this is too naive, we won't have enough customers, ...
This again is &quot;fear&quot;, we fear not to have these customers or investors or ...</p>
<p>The world is <strong>awakening</strong> fast, there are many proof points.
Many companies are looking to do business in a more sustainable way. Not based on lies. I am 100% convinced if we live &amp; advocate our values we will get them back from other companies and we will be hugely successful by doing so.</p>
<p>My biggest dream is to help create a company which is as much as possible &quot;ego&quot; less and tries to beat &quot;fear&quot; on a daily basis.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that not giving in to fear &amp; ego will create a more successful company. </p>
<p>Doing good and making money can go hand in hand, we need to <strong>trust</strong> that this is the right attitude and will be successful.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#love-yourself-and-others" id="love-yourself-and-others">Love yourself and others.</a></h2>
<p>This value (way of living) probably should be the first one because if you can really do this everything else will come automatically. It's not even that hard to do once you can let go of the brainwashing &amp; fear which has been brought to us. It's important to be able to believe in the inherent good of people.</p>
<p>If you respect/love others so many of the bad things in the world will simply vanish. 
Its starts with loving yourself, so many of us (myself included) did not really love ourselves, we were frustrated, we were not shown that we are beautiful and powerful.</p>
<p>All of us can accomplish a lot and make a real difference as long as we trust in ourselves. By trusting in ourselves we will trust others. If we can trust ourselves, there will be no longer need to please the &quot;ego&quot; in us.</p>
<p><strong>love</strong> is <strong>energy</strong></p>
<p>In a business context this means build a &quot;loving&quot; workspace, respect your colleagues, have fun with them. Even if from a personally perspective someone does not resonate well with you, you can still respect &amp; like him for what he/she is good at. By doing so, automatically people will like and respect you more, it's again a self strengthening circle.</p>
<p>Dare to speak up, if you believe that our chosen values are not met, you need to speak up.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#change-is-good" id="change-is-good">Change is Good</a></h2>
<p>Once upon a time we were on an island where some your entrepreneurs were brought together. Each of them was asked what is the most important tool you have introduced in your organization to be successful.</p>
<p>A 27 year old Brazilian Lady CEO came with the following words: <strong>Everything is a working hypothesis</strong>. She explained that in her company everyone is now embracing change and that they use 20% effort to come to conclusion then they go for it and quickly improve to next iterations whenever required. This was helping her company to evolve much more quickly and stay agile. By putting it so strong everyone understood that change is welcome &amp; expected.</p>
<p>Evolution happens because of change. Change is the source of anny innovation or growth.
Embrace change, don't fight it. Change now is faster than it has ever been.</p>
<p>Change is not the same as disruption, disruption destroys something, change needs to be positive, it needs to bring us closer to our goals.</p>
<p>Sometimes changes means we need to loose something first, we need to take a step back before we can go forward.</p>
<p>In a business context: I use as a rule of thumb, if within 2/3 months you get a ROI (Return On Investment) of the change you suggest you need to execute the change even if it hurts in the short term.</p>
<p>Change needs lead to something which is nicer, more clean, more elegant, more modular, ... it's something positive, it's creating a better end result.</p>
<p>SUPER IMPORTANT: <strong>Change should always lead to Less Complexity</strong></p>
<p>Don't let fear guide you to stick to an existing suboptimal solution.
Everytime I let fear guide me I delayed the wanted outcome and afterwards we wished that we had not taken the shortcut and had done the change how impossible it might have looked at that point (this really happened every time again).</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#avoid-complexity" id="avoid-complexity">Avoid complexity</a></h2>
<p>The world has been born out of few elements and all was very simple.
Combination of simple elements can create something very powerful as long as these elements (organism) work together. This has lead to more complex organism like ourselves. 
The basic building blocks though are very easy.</p>
<p>We need constantly strive for less complexity, for elegance, for beauty.</p>
<p>Every Time you see something complex, you need to try and look where does this come from, don't settle for it, I am sure there is an easier more elegant way.</p>
<p>Complexity is the enemy for further change, it blocks the path and that is why it cannot be accepted.</p>
<p>Complexity also leads to miscommunication more errors further on the path.</p>
<p>Allow to give some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>complex redundant IT systems build to provide more uptime (e.g. in datacenters) always had worse uptime then the non redundant systems which were easy.</li>
<li>complex contracts lead to misunderstanding and issues further on the path, it can lead to distrust.</li>
<li>complex excel sheets are more wrong than the simple back on the envelope calculation made by someone with some experience</li>

<h1><a class="header" href="#personal-note-how-are-we-doing-2019" id="personal-note-how-are-we-doing-2019">Personal Note. How are we doing? 2019</a></h1>
<p>This document has been written early 2017. Since then quite some friends have read this document and the response was quite positive. 
Update now in 2019:</p>
<p>To like and agree with these values is the easy part, to live up to these values is super hard.</p>
<p>Every day it's my own fight not to be scared and keep on pushing what I believe to be the right set of values. </p>
<p>The most heard argument is that other companies/people do it differently.</p>
<p>Recently it made me quite frustrated, I was pushing too hard. I just realized that I should not push at all but just offer a choice.</p>
<p>Everything can be brought back to a very simple choice. Are we willing to follow the path of faith in humanity (respect) &amp; love, if yes everything is possible but this is hard to do. Every day the newspapers or television shows us how most of us are not ready to do that yet. Non tolerance (legal force, fear even hatred) is being preached as a way of doing business &amp; run our world. It's so easy to get scared as a result of this.</p>
<p>Personally I don't want to live that way, I have chosen for respect &amp; love, these 2 simple words are enough to see everything differently. To me the new digital world which is unfolding all around us is like a new dimension with a different set of rules. These rules can be different, they are disconnected from governments &amp; large corporations.
I don't want lengthy contracts any more, I want partners with which together we can build a better world and as result we are successful. </p>
<p>Money is not a dirty word it's a form of energy, it allows us to do good. Building a sustainable business following good values will be much more profitable &amp; stable in the long run as some hasty greed based shortcut driven business.</p>
<p>Can this work? YES, I see it every day, many people &amp; companies want to do business this way. It's a new economy being born. It will take some time but it's all happening.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#intro-1" id="intro-1">Intro</a></h1>
<p>Building startups is not easy and finding the right mix of people very challenging.</p>
<p>There are many models on the internet around profiling people, but most of them we find way too complex e.g around Quotients some models use up to 9 different types which I believe is too complex.</p>
<p>This document is our attempt to simplify lots of information we found on the internet and bring some new structure to it.</p>
<p>We believe we only need 3 Quotients and can add everything else underneath.
We also believe that we can link these Quotients to different parts of our mind (see last paragraph), we have done quite some work around the role of these minds, in the future we are planning to also publish this information. </p>
<p>We believe that any person working for a startup needs to have a minimal skill level in the 3 main Quotients as defined below.
If not then this person will not be very effective and potentially even damage the culture &amp; efficiency of a startup.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#iq-intellectual-quotient" id="iq-intellectual-quotient">IQ (Intellectual Quotient)</a></h2>
<p>IQ lead us to think, make cause-effect analysis, doin' math, describe something' and create our level of understanding. But many people just concentrate in this holy shit thing! Because I thought before, this is our future, what we learn at school, 8 hours per day, 6 days a week for 16 years in elementary school, junior high school, senior high school, and college.</p>
<p>People with high IQ Exhibits the following Characteristics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Logical and analytical ability</li>
<li>Inquisitiveness</li>
<li>Problem-solving skills</li>
<li>Interest in reading and using language effectively</li>
<li>Extraordinary memory with numbers and words.</li>
<li>Perfectionism</li>

<h3><a class="header" href="#pq-physical-quotient--the-physical-part-of-iq" id="pq-physical-quotient--the-physical-part-of-iq">PQ (Physical Quotient) = the physical part of IQ</a></h3>
<p>PQ is our body of course! We should count it on, coz' our body, my body is beautiful. Hohoho.. It has authority for a living. My brain executes heart to beat, lungs to suck the air, self-healing, laughing, sneeze, and also fart! pufff... It's amazing. Isn't it?</p>
<p>Physical Quotient (PQ) indicates the capacity to work through situation through your physical proves. That means effective and efficient use of your hand eyes coordination. Kind of skill and flawless fluidity demonstrated by sportsman, warriors, fighters, performers, athletes, dancer etc.</p>
<p>Its intelligence of the body.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#eq-emotional-quotient-" id="eq-emotional-quotient-">EQ (Emotional Quotient )</a></h2>
<p>EQ is knowledge about knowing our self, sensitivity to feel change in our environment and also to estimate time, empathy, communication skill (I called it communication with voice and also with gesture, either with heart), courageous to confess our mistakes, respect diversity, etc. Who gonna be successful leader should develop these more than others! but keep your life in balance!</p>
<ul>
<li>People with high EQ exhibits and express their feelings clearly and directly.</li>
<li>They are not dominated by negative emotions such as fear, worry, guild, shame, embarrassment, obligation, disappointment and hopelessness.</li>
<li>They are able to read non-verbal communication.</li>
<li>They balance feelings with reason, logic and reality.</li>
<li>They are independent, self reliant and morally autonomous who can work and thirve with interdependence very effectively.</li>
<li>They are internally self-motivated.</li>
<li>They are not motivated by power, wealth, but are more influenced by fame, relationship and approval by other.</li>
<li>They are always people and group smart who work well in groups, teams and best in making relationship and maintain them.</li>
<li>They are emotionally expressive yet resilient.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="header" href="#aq--associative-thinking-as-a-result-of-eq" id="aq--associative-thinking-as-a-result-of-eq">AQ = Associative thinking as a result of EQ</a></h3>
<p>Associative thinking underlies most of our purely emotional intelligence (EQ) - the link between one emotion and another, between emotions and bodily feelings, emotions and the environment. It is also able to recognise patterns like faces or smells, and to learn bodily skills like riding a bicycle or driving a car. It is 'thinking' with the heart and the body and so is thought of as our 'emotional intelligence' or the 'body's intelligence'. The structures within the brain with which we do our associative thinking are known as neural networks. Each of these networks contains bundles of up to 100,000 neurons, and each neuron in a bundle may be connected to as many as 1,000 others. Unlike the precise wiring of neural tracts, in neural networks each neuron acts upon or is acted upon by, many others simultaneously.</p>
<p>Unlike serial neural tracts which are rule bound or program-bound and thus unable to learn, neural networks have the ability to rewire themselves in dialogue with experience. All associative learning is done by trial and error. This kind of learning is experience-based: the more times I perform a skill successfully, the more inclined I will be to do it that way next time. Associative learning is also tacit learning - I learn the skill, but I can't articulate any rules by which I learned it and usually can't even describe how I did so. Neural networks are not connected with our language faculty, nor with our ability to articulate concepts. They are simply embedded in experience. We feel our skills, we do our skills, but we don't think or talk about them. We develop our skills because they give us a sense of satisfaction or a feeling of reward, or because they help us avoid pain.</p>
<p>Thus most emotions are developed by <strong>trial-and-error</strong>, a slow associative build-up of response to certain stimuli. and they are quite habit-bound. Once I have learned to feel anger at a given stimulus, it is difficult for me to react differently next time. Much of psychotherapy exists to help people break the habit of long-standing but inappropriate emotional association.</p>
<p>Like other aspects of associative intelligence, emotions are not immediately verbal. We often have trouble talking about them, at least with any accuracy, and they are certainly not always 'rational' in the sense of obeying rules or predictions. They often respond to incomplete data in unpredictable ways.</p>
<p>Associative intelligence is able to deal with ambiguous situations, but it is also 'approximate'. It is more flexible but less accurate that serial thinking. The disadvantages of this type of thinking are that it is slowly learned, inaccurate and tends to be habit-bound or tradition bound. We can relearn a skill or an emotional response, but it takes time and much effort. And because associative thinking is tacit, we often have difficulty sharing it with others. We can't just write out a formula and tell someone else to get on with the job. All of us must learn a skill in our own way, for ourselves. No two brains have the same set of neural connections.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#sq-spiritual-intelligence" id="sq-spiritual-intelligence">SQ (Spiritual Intelligence)</a></h2>
<p>Spiritual intelligence (SQ) could also be called the 'intelligence of meaning'. It is what makes us essentially human: the ability to plan, to make sense of our emotions, to control our impulses, to make choices, and endow our world with meaning. </p>
<p>It's helping us to stack our principles, values, and connect our soul with our beliefs, our purposes in life. Just this quotient when can claim that we are the most valuable creatures on earth</p>
<p>Spiritual Intelligence (SQ), expands the horizon of human Ego. It expands and harmonize the horizon of human awareness and influence to the largest possible dimensions which are all inclusive.</p>
<p>Whereas IQ is rule based, EQ helps us act appropriately within society's prescribed boundaries, SQ helps us extend and change the boundaries, question our assumptions and formulate new meaning. </p>
<p>SQ is the intelligence of <strong>creativity</strong>. It is linked with creating order (less entropy) in the brain from chaos (high entropy). Bringing about new order in our brain is facilitated by engaging in activities related to our least conscious part of the brain (our creative mode) in a playful, non-dutiful fashion. &quot;SQ is our compass 'at the edge' &quot; </p>
<p>People with high SQ exhibit the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flexibility</li>
<li>Tolerance</li>
<li>Self-awareness</li>
<li>Broad inclusive approach.</li>
<li>The ability to go through all challenges with poise and equanimity.</li>
<li>The ability to understand both human, social as well as natural situation easily and able to handle them well.</li>
<li>The ability to inspire by a vision.</li>
<li>An ability to see connections between diverse things and see all holistically and holistically.</li>
<li>A desire and capacity to cause as little harm as possible and promote well-being harmony for all.</li>
<li>A tendency to probe and ask fundamental question about everything.</li>
<li>An ability to go against conventions.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="header" href="#cq-creativity-quotient-result-of-sq" id="cq-creativity-quotient-result-of-sq">CQ (Creativity Quotient) result of SQ</a></h3>
<p>Creativity Quotient is the ability to generate innovative ideas and manifest them from thought into reality. The process involves original thinking and then producing. </p>
<p>Its very closely linked to SQ !</p>
<ul>
<li>People with creativity are fluent thinker, able to generate possibilities, consequences, or relate ideas.</li>
<li>They are flexible thinkers, to use many different alternatives and approaches to the problem solving.</li>
<li>They are original as thinkers, seeking new, unusual or unconventional associations and combinations among items of information.</li>
<li>They often display intellectual playfulness and like to fantasize and imagine.</li>
<li>They are sensitive to beauty and are attracted  to aesthetic values.</li>
<li>They are versatile in use their multiple senses and harmonize them into unique synthesis and solutions.</li>

<p>The world has become one giant network where instantly accessible and shareable information rewrites the future as quickly as it can be understood. Fueled by relentless technological innovation, this accelerating connectivity has created an ever increasing rate of change. As a result, the future is becoming increasingly difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, most organizations still rely on a way of working designed over 100 years ago for the challenges and opportunities of the industrial age. Team structures support routine and static jobs. Siloed, command and control systems enable senior leadership to drive efficiency and predictability at the expense of free information flow, rapid learning, and adaptability.</p>

<p>Organizations are struggling to keep up with their customers. Workers caught between dissatisfied customers and uninspiring leaders are becoming disillusioned and disengaged. Executives caught between discontented investors and disruptive competitors are struggling to find a path forward. And people who want a better world for themselves and their communities are looking to new ambitious organizations to shape our collective future.</p>

<p>Responsive Organizations are built to learn and respond rapidly through the open flow of information; encouraging experimentation and learning on rapid cycles; and organizing as a network of employees, customers, and partners motivated by shared purpose.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-responsive-org" id="what-is-a-responsive-org">WHAT IS A RESPONSIVE ORG?</a></h2>
<p>There’s a reason we’ve run organizations the way we have. Our old Command and Control operating model was well-suited for complicated and predictable challenges. Some of these challenges still exist today and may respond to the industrial-era practices that we know so well. However, as the pace of change accelerates, the challenges we face are becoming less and less predictable. Those practices that were so successful in the past are counter-productive in less predictable environments. In contrast, Responsive Organizations are designed to thrive in less predictable environments by balancing the following tensions:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>old school</th><th>responsive org</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>More Predictable</td><td>Less Predictable</td></tr>
<tr><td>Profit</td><td>Purpose</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hierarchies</td><td>Networks</td></tr>
<tr><td>Controlling</td><td>Empowering</td></tr>
<tr><td>Planning</td><td>Experimentation</td></tr>
<tr><td>Privacy</td><td>Transparency</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h3><a class="header" href="#profit---purpose" id="profit---purpose">Profit &lt;-&gt; Purpose</a></h3>
<p>In the past, the goal for many organizations was creating economic value for shareholders or owners. In other words, &quot;making money&quot;, and quite often with a short-term lens. While many have been hugely successful at this, it has often involved trade-offs: diminishing public trust in organizations across many industries; shortening life spans of organizations; plummeting levels of employee engagement; and damaging the environment around us.
Today people are looking for organizations that have a purpose broader than just making money. Rather than viewing profit as the primary goal of an organization, progressive leaders see profit as a byproduct of success. They aim to do well by doing good. A clear and visionary purpose brings together stunning talent, committed shareholders, partners, and communities.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#controlling---empowering" id="controlling---empowering">Controlling &lt;-&gt; Empowering</a></h3>
<p>In the past, a limited number of people held the power and understanding necessary to steer the organization and its public image. Control was forced through centralized, top down decision-making. Corporate Communications, IT departments, and rigid processes controlled what people said and did. The higher up the pyramid you were, the more power you had. This makes sense in a world where a select few people are most likely to have the knowledge and experience necessary to make the best decisions.
Today, that is no longer the case. Circumstances and markets change rapidly as information flows faster. Now the people with the best insight and decision-making ability are often people closest to the customers, on the front line, or even 'outside' the typical organizational boundaries. Rather than controlling through process and hierarchy, you achieve better results by inspiring and empowering people at the edges to pursue the work as they see fit – strategically, structurally, and tactically.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#planning---experimentation" id="planning---experimentation">Planning &lt;-&gt; Experimentation</a></h3>
<p>In the past, organizations competed by optimizing productivity, efficiency and predictability with long term planning. Relying on planning was important because high transaction costs made it difficult to change course once decisions had been made, resources had been committed, and people and teams had been coordinated.
Today, plans start losing value the moment they're finished. Because we can't predict the future, time and resources devoted to planning are a less valuable investment than embracing agile methods that encourage experimentation and fuel rapid learning. The opposite of planning doesn’t have to be chaos. Responsive organizations still need a long term vision, but make progress through experimentation and iteration.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#hierarchies---networks" id="hierarchies---networks">Hierarchies &lt;-&gt; Networks</a></h3>
<p>In the past there were big and complex tasks that required many people working on them. The 'transaction costs' involved to get coordination between people was high, so the concept of a Manager was introduced. As the number of Managers increased, a Manager of the Managers was created... and hierarchies formed.
This resulted in order, clarity of authority, rank, and power. They reinforced a single primary connection: manager to worker, and enabled a command and control style of leadership that was terrifically successful during the industrial era.
Today, technology and connectivity has increased our ability to self-organize, collaborating more easily across internal and external organizational boundaries. It is no longer necessarily true that coordinating through a Manager is more effective than people self-organizing. Working as a network allows us to organize with many different kinds of connections, and increased autonomy.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#privacy---transparency" id="privacy---transparency">Privacy &lt;-&gt; Transparency</a></h3>
<p>In the past, information was the currency of power: hard to come by and hard to spread. In the industrial-era environment, organizations guarded this scarce information carefully, and leveraged their information as a competitive advantage.
Today, we have access to so much information that it’s become impossible to predict which information might be useful, or who might use that information in a productive way. In this world of abundant information and connectedness the potential benefits of trusting people who share the organization’s purpose to act on information as they see fit often outweighs the potential risks of open information being used in counter-productive ways.</p>

<p>We believe that a company needs to have a strong set of values and being open and transparent about our code is not only our obligation but it also has clear benefits for ours users &amp; company.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#why-do-we-do-everything-open-source" id="why-do-we-do-everything-open-source">Why Do We Do Everything Open Source?</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#quality" id="quality">Quality</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>allow anyone to inspect our code on quality as well as good intentions.</li>
<li>better stability because more people test &amp; inspect the code.</li>
<li>be 100% transparent about bugs, functions &amp; roadmap.</li>
<li>allow anyone to give feedback on the product through the open code repositories.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="header" href="#security" id="security">Security</a></h3>
<p>The more people dive into our code (especially for code like blockchain code and the id management solution) the more reliable &amp; secure our code will be.
This can only work if this code is 100% open source, otherwise contributors would not be interested to participate.</p>
<p>There are many companies who will only trust our code from a security &amp; privacy perspective because our code is transparent and can be openly inspected.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#software-traction-more-people-using-our-software" id="software-traction-more-people-using-our-software">Software traction (more people using our software)</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>allow anyone to play with the code &amp; define for themselves if the code performs as promoted.</li>
<li>allow any developer to contribute to our code base.</li>
<li>allow 3e party software companies to further build solutions on top of us, the fact that we are open source is a must for many independent software companies.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="header" href="#trust" id="trust">Trust</a></h3>
<p>We want trust to be based on what we create not on what we tell.
What you see is what you get. We are not afraid of being transparent about bugs or any possible issue in our code. We are proud on what we create. We want to earn you trust.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#increase-company-value" id="increase-company-value">Increase company value</a></h3>
<p>Increase our company value is of course important to our investors and anyone involved with the company. The stronger our company the better for all of us.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is to get the maximum amount of users using the software.</p>
<p>Of course its also our duty to make sure that people do not abuse our values and respect our work, that is why we use a fair source license for certain parts of our work.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#we-believe-all-code-needs-to-be-available-under-fair-or-open-source-license" id="we-believe-all-code-needs-to-be-available-under-fair-or-open-source-license">We believe <strong>all</strong> code needs to be available under fair or open source license</a></h2>
<p>This means all components should be on a public repo like github.
We do not support any closed source software, we believe its not from this time anymore.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#open-source-licenses" id="open-source-licenses">Open source licenses</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>examples: apache, bsd, (l)gpl</li>
<li>typically allow usage of source code for any purpose</li>
<li>typically the user needs to leave the license intact &amp; show the origin of the code as well as the code itself</li>
<li>some are more limited like GPL which is restrictive in how it links to other code (if you link to GPL code your code needs to be GPL as well)</li>
<li>code typically lives on code repositories like github.com or gitlab.com</li>
<li>millions of people have access to these code repositories</li>
<li>certain repositories have hundreds of people from all over the world contributing to such a repository</li>
<li>all our core components have an open source license.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="header" href="#fair-source-license-fairio" id="fair-source-license-fairio">Fair source license (fair.io)</a></h3>
<p>For us personally everything can be open source, but some want to use a less open license which allows people to still inspect the code but there are certain limitations what you can do with the code.</p>
<p>Such a license is fair source:</p>
<ul>
<li>See <a href="https://fair.io/">www.fair.io</a>.</li>
<li>The source code is open &amp; visible.</li>
<li>But the license disallows the code to be used in enterprise or commercial context (max amount of people per organization using this code).</li>
<li>This license allows people to inspect the code and still contribute.</li>
<li>It allows us to be 100% transparent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes it makes sense to have specific components typically important for private/commercial context as fair source.</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#3-breakthroughs" id="3-breakthroughs">3 Breakthroughs:</a></h3>
<p>All Teal organizations are based on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Self-management. Teal organizations have found the key to upgrading their structures from hierarchical, bureaucratic pyramids to powerful and fluid systems of distributed authority and collective intelligence</li>
<li>Wholeness.  Organizations have always been places that encourage people to show up with a narrow “professional” self. Teal organizations have developed a consistent set of practices that invite us to drop the mask, reclaim our inner wholeness, and bring all of who we are to work.</li>
<li>Evolutionary purpose.  Teal organizations are seen as having a life and a sense of direction of their own. Instead of trying to predict and control the future, members of the organization are invited to listen and understand what the organization is drawn to become, where it naturally wants to go. </li>

<h3><a class="header" href="#example---favi-automotive" id="example---favi-automotive">Example - FAVI Automotive:</a></h3>
<p>How are they Teal? </p>
<ul>
<li>Once a week, the sales account person from, say, the Audi mini-factory meets with his team- mates to share the order for the week. </li>
<li>Everyone joins in the joy if the order is large or the disappointment if the order is small. </li>
<li>Planning happens on the spot, and the team jointly agrees on a shipping date.</li>
<li>Sometimes, the sales account person has bad news to share: Chinese competition quoted a very low price. Can we match it? </li>
<li>People knock their heads together and figure out if they feel they can shave another few minutes off the machining process. </li>
<li>The teammates don’t have—and don’t need—targets or bosses. They face their clients and competitors directly and know that their jobs depend on doing a good job and making wise decisions. They are proud of the work they do and their capacity to self-organize. </li>
</ul>
<p>Do we agree?</p>

</ul>
<p>Really - what should we amend?</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t agree that just any employee can pull the trigger and buy the machine.  Reduces iterations and time massively vs people working in isolation</li>
<li>Would have final stakeholder meeting to agree and / or modify as required - then the QB can pull the trigger</li>

<p>Do we agree?</p>
<ul>
<li>Think this is a pretty good approach</li>
</ul>
<p>Really - what should we amend?</p>
<ul>
<li>Probably works better to circulate to smaller (but still comprehensive) group of QBs before circulating to everyone</li>
<li>This will save time as everyone reads (and reacts to) the Chairman’s messages - and we want to be respectful of their time</li>

<h3><a class="header" href="#bill-belichick" id="bill-belichick">Bill Belichick</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Leadership means building a team that's exhaustively prepared, but able to adjust in an instant  &quot;The only sign we have in the locker room is from 'The Art of War.' 'Every battle is won before it is fought,'&quot; says Belichick, who started breaking down films of opposing teams when he was 7 years old and hanging out with his dad, Steve, an assistant coach at Annapolis</li>
<li>Leadership means having the discipline to deploy your &quot;dependables&quot;  You know your star performers? The ones who can dazzle and amaze, except when they don't? They're definitely appealing, Belichick admits.  But over the years, he's learned they're not his type. He'd rather stick with his tried-and-true people — call them his &quot;dependables.&quot;</li>
<li>Leadership means being the boss.  Belichick says this principle first came to him when he was just 23, addressing the Colts as a special teams coach. Two players, one of them a talented starter, spent the beginning of the meeting giggling and chatting. Inside, Belichick recalls, he was seething: &quot;I'm not afraid of these guys. It's either [them] or me. We can't run a team like this.&quot;  Finally, he let loose. &quot;Look, either you shut up or you get out of here. That's it.&quot;  It worked.  And it was an aha moment that has guided him since. &quot;I don't care if they're a star player,&quot; he says. &quot;I don't care who they are. You have to set the tone.&quot;</li>
<li>Leadership means caring about everything going on in the lives of your people.  Maybe the previous rule would make you think otherwise, but Belichick strongly believes you must see your team not just as players, per se, but as people who have full, three-dimensional, and often messy lives.  &quot;There are a lot of things that affect what happens on the field that occur off the field,&quot; he says. Players &quot;have wives and girlfriends. And they have babies. And they have personal situations. They have parents that are sick. All of it runs in together.&quot;</li>
<li>Leadership means never resting on your laurels.  Ask Belichick if he's still celebrating the stunning come-from-behind Super Bowl victory in February and you get another &quot;You're killing me here&quot; look.  &quot;We're onto 2017. No one cares about 2016 anymore,&quot; he says. &quot;You can't look back. We don't talk about last year. We don't talk about next week. We talk about today, and we talk about the next game. That's all we can really control.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="header" href="#nick-saban" id="nick-saban">Nick Saban</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Make routine decisions habitual so they don’t require mental energy. Saban famously eats two Oatmeal Creme Pies for breakfast every morning. He also eats the same salad every day for lunch. It’s not that he wouldn’t enjoy a more varied diet; he eats the same thing so he doesn’t have to spend a single second debating what he wants for breakfast or lunch</li>
<li>Focus on the process over the outcome. Every great leader I know is fascinated by the process. Nearly every follower is obsessed with outcomes. Questions: What processes are the most important to experience the outcomes you desire?</li>
<li>Be willing to hire toward your weakness. Because hiring is difficult, leaders often make one of two mistakes: they either hire someone just like them or they are afraid to hire someone better than them. (See: You Don’t Have to Do It on Your Own)</li>
<li>Questions:  Does your team look exactly like you?  What is your greatest weakness? Does one of your key team members have that quality as their greatest strength?</li>
<li>Control the story. Saban is a master in handling the media. Every season he goes on a rant or two in order to divert the media’s attention away from one story-line and to redirect it back to what he believes is important.  Questions:  How do others feel about the organization you lead? Co-workers? Clients? Outsiders? Is the story they have written the right one?  What information could you share which would encourage others or positively change the story they have written?</li>
<li>Everything matters. Saban is often viewed as a micro-manager. While the term is normally viewed as a negative, for Saban it’s listed as a strength. In his view, everything matters. There is nothing so minor or inconsequential that it is out of his site of concern. Everything speaks to the culture of the organization, influences the people involved, and plays a role in determining success and failure.  Questions:  What details have your overlooked to your detriment?</li>
<li>Dress for success.  Look like the guy w a plan</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="header" href="#jamie-dimon-jp-morgan" id="jamie-dimon-jp-morgan">Jamie Dimon (JP Morgan)</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Always be transparent – about everything: Transparency from leadership is critical to building a culture of trust. &quot;Share everything,&quot; Dimon said. &quot;You never want someone to walk into a meeting thinking you're hiding information. You can't play that game.&quot;</li>
<li>Address conflicts immediately: &quot;Don't avoid problems or confrontations,&quot; Dimon suggested. &quot;Conflicts don't age well. Deal with issues sooner rather than later as they don't resolve themselves. They get worse.&quot;</li>
<li>Experience your business firsthand</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="header" href="#bill-mcdermott-sap" id="bill-mcdermott-sap">Bill McDermott (SAP)</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Lead with a higher purpose.  &quot;Having a higher purpose has to touch both the customer and your people because you are playing for stakes beyond money.&quot;  If you are running a company and haven't defined your purpose for existence beyond making money, don't do another thing. If you are thinking of starting a company determine the purpose, before you even think about developing a website.</li>
<li>Surround yourself with better people.  One of the biggest mistakes I see entrepreneurs make is thinking they have to be be the expert in everything.</li>
<li>McDermott said he learned early in his career that &quot;every leader has to have the humility to recognize their success will be based on choosing the very best people.&quot;  One of the best ways to surround yourself with better people is to know your strengths and then hire people around you who excel in your areas of weakness.</li>
<li>Learn from others, but be authentic.  &quot;At the end of the day leaders have to be authentic,&quot; McDermott told me. &quot;And the only way to do that is to learn from other great leaders and make those lessons your own.&quot;</li>
<li>Don't mess up the business strategy.  &quot;Leaders can be forgiven for a lot of mistakes, but they will never be forgiven for a bad strategy.&quot;  There are a lot of different kinds of strategies a leader can put into action. But if the strategy doesn't help your customer be more successful, then it has little-to-no chance to succeed.</li>
<li>Make trust as the linchpin.  The only way to earn trust is to give trust unconditionally, first. Humans have enormous instinctual power to know who is the real deal. Show your people who you are every single day through your actions not your words.</li>
<li>Focus on the root cause of success.  Every organization has to get results for the business to survive. It's one thing to know the results, but it's much more valuable to understand the root cause of the results. If you understand the root cause of what produces results then you have the power to motivate your people.</li>
<li>Remember, it's a work in progress.  Business and leadership is a journey and keeping the mindset of the long game will always serve you well. In McDermott's words: &quot;Every day we have to be constantly reinventing what we brought from yesterday and keep dreaming about what we can be tomorrow.&quot;</li>
<li>Ask yourself: How many of these lessons are you are implementing on an ongoing basis? If you identify some gaps, there is no better time to start filling them than the present.</li>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-reaction" id="summary-reaction">Summary Reaction:</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Holocracy.  This is awesome - by far the best in my view - self organization, transparency, match skillsets with workstreams.  We are doing a pretty good job on that so far at TF</li>
<li>GitHub:  Also good.  Though GOGS (our GiitHub equivalent) is not as easy to work with as google docs - and will take longer as people need to learn the tools (internally and externally...)</li>
<li>Transparency: Folks are embracing transparency well I think</li>
<li>Transparent compensation.  Not so great.  Dont see the benefits (neither does Daniel Tenner, btw...)</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#open-vs-closed-culture" id="open-vs-closed-culture">Open vs Closed Culture</a></h2>
<p>Do we Agree?:  Yes - broadly.  Though Mr. Tenner needs to refine his views on transparent pay etc (he wants it to work - but doesnt seem to believe it works)</p>
<p>Are we on track with a lot of this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good: Transparency, Flat-ish hierarchy, working via groups of stakeholders, focusing on value drivers not just profits</li>
<li>Also good: Trust is pretty good</li>
<li>Less Good:  We need to be more transparent with the rest of GIG (communication strategy for TFF, IYO, GIG.Tech).</li>
<li>Less Good: Also we need to tell people where they stand in terms of company and compensation package...</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#you-cant-hide-from-yourself" id="you-cant-hide-from-yourself">You can’t hide from yourself</a></h2>
<p>Do we Agree?:  Founders of course want control - its their baby.  This is natural and ok</p>
<p>Are we on track:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good:  Company 3.0 communication channels can make more clear values and goals</li>
<li>Good: folks are liking and adapting well to the new workstyle (w occasional glitches admittedly)</li>
<li>Less good:  there are times when convenience trumps principle</li>
<li>Less good:  we maybe need to be better prepared to live with the decisions we take (they are usually teh right decisions at the time…)</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#there-are-no-b-players" id="there-are-no-b-players">There are no B Players</a></h2>
<p>Do we Agree?:  On this one I think Daniel Tenner spot on.  We are dealing with very talented people.  We need to recognise talents and adapt team accordingly…</p>
<p>Are we on track:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good:  We are doing this well in most cases - Andreas, Nickolay, Bram, Hutton, Weynand, etc</li>
<li>Not good:  We need to be careful about rating people based on one inflexible scorecard.  People have different talents and add value in different areas (some people can code, some have ideas, some are leaders, some are executers, some have relationships, some can sell, etc…)</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-advice-process" id="the-advice-process">The Advice Process</a></h2>
<p>Do we Agree?:  Think advice process great for some things (design, strategy, execution, etc)  Daniel Tenner points out it is terrible for other things (compensation for instance)</p>
<p>Are we on track:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good:  we already use advice process and collaborate on everything</li>
<li>Good:  We ask advice from stakeholders on big decisions, steps, etc</li>
<li>Less Good:  we need to trust the process a bit more - sometimes we don’t get to timely decision or we second guess our decision after the fact - we should fix those issues</li>
<li>Less good:  we have waaaaaaaaaaay too many telegram groups</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#fake-transparency" id="fake-transparency">Fake Transparency</a></h2>
<p>Do we Agree?:  This is actually a rubbish blog - because D Teller focuses too much on “transparent compensation” which he obviously wants to believe in (but clearly does not...)
The right thing to focus on would be: giving everyone the whole picture</p>
<p>Are we on track:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good:  we are definitely becoming more transparent (daily) </li>
<li>Less good: People don’t have the full picture (for instance IYO was a surprise to some people)</li>
<li>Also less good:  it is clear some GIG folks want to better understand why we are doing w IYO and TFF </li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#values-show-up-at-the-extremities" id="values-show-up-at-the-extremities">Values show up at the extremities</a></h2>
<p>Do we Agree?:  Sure.  Better quote would have been “everyone loves principles - until they start costing money”</p>
<p>Are we on track:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good:  we are pretty value-focussed - most of the time we are trying to do the right thing.  Can’t think of many examples where we try to take advantage </li>
<li>Less Good: sometimes we are maybe a little too smart for our own good - complexity sometimes erodes principles / values</li>
</ul>

<h2><a class="header" href="#radical-transparency" id="radical-transparency">Radical transparency</a></h2>
<p>Do we Agree?:  This blog is pretty rubbish and doesnt say much
Radical Candor is a good idea though - and we believe in it - but this blog doesnt do it justice</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#introducing-open-salaries" id="introducing-open-salaries">Introducing Open Salaries</a></h2>
<p>Do we Agree?:  Not really - I think this would be a nightmare for any start up

<h2><a class="header" href="#developing-a-good-culture" id="developing-a-good-culture">Developing a Good Culture</a></h2>
<p>Do we Agree?:  Yes broadly</p>
<p>Are we on track:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good.  We have good people at GIG and ThreeFold - no douchebags</li>
<li>Less Good:  we maybe need to be a bit more tolerant of people from other cultures (eg EMC) - not everything corporates do is bad</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#github-super-lean-management-strategy" id="github-super-lean-management-strategy">GitHub super lean management strategy</a></h2>
<p>Do we Agree?:  Yes.  This is pretty cool</p>
<p>Are we on track:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good.  We are getting there - folks are adopting the new workstyle and liking it (issues, resolution, version control, one source for everything)</li>
<li>Less Good:  For less technical tasks - this is much harder (a good example is subjective situations such as investments, franchises, feature definitions, etc)</li>
<li>Less Good:  also a lot of our tools are not really embraced outside TF and GIG (Google docs, GitHub, etc are difficult for a lot of people…)</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#holacracy" id="holacracy">Holacracy</a></h2>
<p>Do we Agree?:  Totally - this is exactly how Company 3.0 should operaqte.  We should frequently revisit our strategy/values/beliefs to make sure we are on track.  We should let our QBs self-organise.  We should collaborate real time.  Doing is better than perfect... </p>
<p>Are we on track:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good.  We are mostly good on this front</li>
<li>Less Good:  sometimes the groups are too big (eg when token kicked off w 50 people going every direction)</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#responsiveorg" id="responsiveorg">Responsive.org</a></h2>
<p>Do we Agree?:  Totally - also a great article - same as Holacracy above.  This article should probably focus more on self organising though in my view</p>

<li>Good.  We are mostly good on this front</li>

<h2><a class="header" href="#open-salaries" id="open-salaries">Open Salaries</a></h2>
<p>Do we Agree?:  Not really.  And neither does Daniel Tenner so I dont see why he spends so much time on the topic...</p>
<p>Are we on track:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good.  Our salary policy is at least being thought through so compansation is broadly aligned</li>
<li>Less good.  We need to communicate comp asap</li>

<p>Do we Agree?:  Dont know </p>
<p>Are we on track:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good.  Think people buy into the culture - they like the collaboration - like the transparency - like the values</li>
<li>Less good.  Some things will take time - we are just two weeks into using GitHub for instance….</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#evolving-purpose---grant-tree" id="evolving-purpose---grant-tree">Evolving Purpose - Grant Tree</a></h2>
<p>Do we Agree?:  I feel pretty strongly that “Doing is way better than Perfect” - this by definition means you must change the hypothesis sometimes - which I think is v healthy
This blog is terrible though - and focused on totally the wrong purposes - make money, make more money, get scale, think about values/strategy/etc... </p>
<p>Are we on track:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good.  We are pretty good about Doing is better than perfect</li>
<li>Less Good:  we probably second guess our decisions too much</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#zappos-holacracy" id="zappos-holacracy">Zappos Holacracy</a></h2>
<p>Do we Agree?:  Not really.  This memo sounds v fake.  In my view this is code for downsizing managers - they are just trying to downsize and fire a bunch of people but call it Holacracy</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#first-lets-fire-the-managers-morningstar" id="first-lets-fire-the-managers-morningstar">First lets fire the Managers (Morningstar)</a></h2>

<p>Do we Agree?:  Maybe - this is just body language</p>
<p>Are we on track:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good:  we dont have a lot of aggressive, shouty douchebags - so we are lucky</li>
<li>Less good:  sometimes we could be more positive</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#examples-of-companies" id="examples-of-companies">Examples of companies</a></h2>
<p>Do we Agree?:  So so - he appears to be really reaching here.</p>
<ul>
<li>I would have focused on real “culture” companies like GitHub</li>
<li>Also (dare we say it) - probably Google - they allow a lot of decentralized autonomous self governance - and are pretty transparent (at least internally...)</li>
<li>Whole Foods also is interesting with the self governing units at store level (though obviously hierarchical…)</li>
<li>The  gaming and content companies (Stripe, Valve, Medium) are in the who cares category...</li>
<li>Zappos is a terrible example - as they appear to be fake / using Holocracy as excuse for downsizing</li>

<li>be at service, make each team member as successful as possible</li>
<li>coach: provide required knowledge &amp; experience (e.g. about the mission(s))</li>
<li>deal with reviews, ...</li>

<li>information needs to be modular so it can be re-used</li>
<li>information needs to be version controlled &amp; change should be visible</li>
<li>information is without design !!! its just text or structured data
<ul>
<li>e.g. don't loose lots of data reformatting, trying to get the fonts right, headers with right numbers, ...</li>
<li>use a easy textual format which can express everything you need (e.g. markdown) and then conversion tools will create the required format: website, pdf, ...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>structured data can be expressed in human readable data formats and also stored in information management systems like git (examples of human readable data formats are yaml, toml, ...).
<ul>
<li>lots of people believe that data only belongs in databases, which is absolutely not correct, any complex system can be recreated by means of some easy to read structured data formats, it would be not super user friendly at beginning but once understood its super powerful and much more transparent.</li>

<li>don't hide, everything needs to be visible for the groups of people you work with</li>
<li>work done needs to be traceable and open
<ul>
<li>anyone should be able to see work done by who when and how much, this transparency allows to see what contributions of people are and that way have an automation information flow.</li>

<h2><a class="header" href="#dynamic-roles-replace-static-job-descriptions" id="dynamic-roles-replace-static-job-descriptions">Dynamic Roles Replace Static Job Descriptions</a></h2>
<p>In most companies each person has exactly one job description. That description is often imprecise, outdated, and irrelevant to their day-to-day work. In Teal, people have multiple roles, often on different teams, and those role descriptions are constantly updated by the team actually doing the work. This allows people a lot more freedom to express their creative talents, and the company can take advantage of those skills in a way it couldn’t before. Since roles are not directly tied to the people filling them, people can hand-off and pick-up new roles fairly easily. But more than that, it means that when you’re filling a role, you’re able to energize the work with a level of clarity and awareness most traditional employees don’t have. For example, in football you know to pass to the striker not because you’re friends with him, but because he’s in the best position to score. Even if you’re mad at the person playing the striker position, you’ll still pass the ball to that role because the strategy of the game suggests that you should. Similarly, in Teal the roles are vested with authority, not the people. This means that the roles and the authorities can be constantly updated without office politics.</p>
<p><em>“Everything is vague to a degree you do not realize till you have tried to make it precise.”</em>
— Bertrand Russell, The Philosophy of Logical Atomism</p>
<p><img src="docs/collaboration/teal/images/dif1.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#distributed-authority-replaces-delegated-authority" id="distributed-authority-replaces-delegated-authority">Distributed Authority Replaces Delegated Authority</a></h2>
<p>The agility that Teal provides comes directly from truly distributed authority. In traditional organizations, managers loosely delegate authority, but ultimately, their decisions always trump those they manage and everybody knows it. Any initiative outside the norm typically requires the boss’ approval, explicitly or implicitly. In Teal, authority is truly distributed and decisions are made locally by the individual closest to the front line. Teams are self-organized: they’re given a purpose, but they decide internally how to best reach it. In this way, Teal replaces the traditional hierarchy with a series of interconnected but autonomous teams (“circles”). This shift can dramatically increase a company’s capacity to adapt to changing conditions. It also allows those companies to have both alignment and agency without the typical pathologies of “leaderless” groups or autocratic micromanagement that slows everything down.</p>
<p><img src="docs/collaboration/teal/images/dif2.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#rapid-iterations-replace-big-re-orgs" id="rapid-iterations-replace-big-re-orgs">Rapid Iterations Replace Big Re-orgs</a></h2>
<p>In traditional companies, the org chart gets revamped every few years. These cyclical “reorgs” are an attempt to keep up with the changing environment, but since they only occur every 3 to 5 years, they are almost always out-of-date. In Teal, the structure of the organization is updated every month in every circle (i.e. what roles are doing and owning what work or decisions). This evolution happens in frequent incremental steps rather than rare massive changes, and it happens in every team at all levels. Companies powered by Teal reorg themselves as often as necessary to capitalize on a learning opportunity or address a critical problem. This happens in frequent “governance meetings” where roles and processes are revised given what’s actually happening in the team.</p>
<p><em>“Most startups believe in iteration of their products. Now they need to apply the same thinking to their organizations.”</em> 
— Adam Pisoni, Yammer co-founder &amp; CTO</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#transparent-rules-replace-office-politics" id="transparent-rules-replace-office-politics">Transparent Rules Replace Office Politics</a></h2>
<p>In many companies, things are done a certain way because “that’s how we’ve always done it”, and those implicit rules are hard to change. Often no one knows why those rules exist, who decided them, or who can change them. This makes distributing authority almost impossible, because there is no way to ensure that everyone is following the same set of rules. In Teal, authority is distributed not from the leader at the top to a group of people, but to an explicit process defined in detail in a written document: the Teal constitution. Everyone is bound by those same rules, even the CEO. The transparency of the rules means that you no longer have to depend on office politics to get things done. With the fundamental rules made accessible to everyone, anyone in the organization can quickly figure out who owns what, the decisions he or she can make, and who to hold accountable for which functions. </p>
<p><em>“One of the principles in Teal is to make the implicit explicit. A ton of it is about creating clarity — who’s in charge of what, who’s making what kind of decisions. And there’s also a system for defining that, and changing that, so it’s very flexible at the same time.”</em>
— Evan Williams, Twitter &amp; Medium co-founder</p>

</ul>
<p>It’s easy to write admirable values; it’s harder to live them. In describing courage we say, “You question actions inconsistent with our values.” We want everyone to help each other live the values and hold each other responsible for being role models. It is a continuous aspirational process. </p>
<p>In describing integrity we say, “You only say things about fellow employees you say to their face.” This attribute is one of the hardest for new people to believe — and to learn to practice. In most situations, both social and work, those who consistently say what they really think about people are quickly isolated and banished. We work hard to get people to give each other professional, constructive feedback — up, down and across the organization — on a continual basis. People frequently ask others, “What could I be doing better?” and themselves, “What feedback have I not yet shared?” </p>
<p>We believe we will learn faster and be better if we can make giving and receiving feedback less stressful and a more normal part of work life. Feedback is a continuous part of how we communicate and work with one another versus an occasional formal exercise. We build trust by being selfless in giving feedback to our colleagues even if it is uncomfortable to do so. Feedback helps us to avoid sustained misunderstandings and the need for rules. Feedback is more easily exchanged if there is a strong underlying relationship and trust between people, which is part of why we invest time in developing those professional relationships. We celebrate the people who are very candid, especially to those in more powerful positions. We know this level of candor and feedback can be difficult for new hires and people in different parts of the world where direct feedback is uncommon. We actively help people learn how to do this at our teal org through coaching and modeling the behaviors we want to see in every employee. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#dream-team" id="dream-team">DREAM TEAM</a></h2>
<p>A dream team1 is one in which all of your colleagues are extraordinary at what they do and are highly effective collaborators. The value and satisfaction of being on a dream team is tremendous. Our version of the great workplace is not comprised of sushi lunches, great gyms, big offices, or frequent parties. Our version of the great workplace is a dream team in pursuit of ambitious common goals, for which we spend heavily. It is on such a team that you learn the most, perform your best work, improve the fastest, accomplish the most, and have the most fun. </p>
<p>To have an entire company comprise the dream team (rather than just a few small groups) is challenging. Unquestionably, we have to hire well. We also have to foster collaboration, support information sharing, and discourage politics. The unusual part is that we give adequate performers a generous severance package2, so that we can find a star for that position. If you think of a professional soccer team, it is up to the coach to ensure that every player on the field is amazing at their position, and plays very effectively with the others. We model ourselves on being a team, not a family. A family is about unconditional love, despite your siblings’ unusual behavior. A dream team is about pushing yourself to be the best teammate you can be, caring intensely about your teammates, and knowing that you may not be on the team forever. </p>
<p>We have no bell curves or rankings or quotas such as “cut the bottom 10% every year.” That would be detrimental to fostering collaboration, and is a simplistic, rules-based approach we would never support. We focus on managers’ judgment through the “keeper test” for each of their people: if one of the members of the team was thinking of leaving for another firm, would the manager try hard to keep them from leaving? Those that do not pass the keeper test (i.e. their manager would not fight to keep them) are promptly and respectfully given a generous severance package so we can find someone for that position that makes us an even better dream team. Getting cut from our team is very disappointing, but there is no shame. Being on a dream team can be the thrill of a professional lifetime. </p>
<p>Given our dream team orientation, it is very important that managers communicate frequently with each of their team members about where they stand so surprises are rare. Also, it is safe for any employee at any time to check in with their manager by asking, “How hard would you work to change my mind if I were thinking of leaving?” In the tension between honesty and kindness, we lean into honesty. No matter how honest, though, we treat people with respect. </p>
<p>One might assume that with dream team focus, people are afraid of making mistakes. In fact, it’s the opposite. We try all kinds of things and make plenty of mistakes as we search for improvement. The keeper test is applied as a judgment of someone’s overall expected contribution. </p>
<p>Within a dream team, collaboration and trust work well because your colleagues are both exceptionally skilled at what they do, and at working well with others. In describing selflessness we say “You make time to help colleagues. You share information openly and proactively.” We want new colleagues to feel very welcome and get all the support they need to be effective. </p>
<p>Some people ask about loyalty. Loyalty is great as a stabilizer. Employees with a strong track record at our teal org get leeway if their performance takes a temporary dip. Similarly, we ask employees to stick with our teal org through any short term dips. But unconditional allegiance to a shrinking firm, or to an adequately performing employee, is not what we are about. </p>
<p>On a dream team, there are no “brilliant jerks.” The cost to teamwork is just too high. Our view is that brilliant people are also capable of decent human interactions, and we insist upon that. When highly capable people work together in a collaborative context, they inspire each other to be more creative, more productive and ultimately more successful as a team than they could be as a collection of individuals. </p>
<p>Succeeding on a dream team is about being effective, not about working hard. Sustained “B” performance, despite an “A” for effort, gets a respectful generous severance package. Sustained “A” performance, regardless of level of effort, gets rewarded. Of course, to be great, most of us have to put in considerable effort, but hard work is not how we measure effectiveness. </p>
<p>Being on a dream team is not right for everyone, and that is OK. Many people value job security very highly, and would prefer to work at the many companies whose orientation is more about stability, seniority, and working around inconsistent employee effectiveness. Our model works best for people who highly value consistent excellence in their colleagues. </p>
<p>To help us attract and retain stunning colleagues, we pay employees at the top of their personal market. We make a good-faith estimate of the highest compensation each employee could make at peer firms, and pay them that max. Typically, we calibrate to market once a year. We do not think of these as “raises” and there is no raise pool to divide up. The market for talent is what it is. We avoid the model of “2% raise for adequate, 4% raise for great.” Some employees’ market value will rapidly rise (both due to their performance and to shortage of talent in their areas) while other employees may be flat year-to-year, despite doing great work. At all times, we aim to pay all of our people at the top of their personal market. </p>
<p>Note that if our company experienced financial difficulty, we wouldn’t ask our employees to accept less pay. A sports team with a losing record still pays top of personal market for the players they hope will get them back into a winning position. On the other hand, if the company does well, our broadly distributed stock options become quite valuable. </p>
<p>The dream team model reinforces the idea that your economic security is based on your skills and reputation, not on your seniority at one company. At our teal org, you learn a lot working on hard problems with amazing colleagues and what you learn increases your market value. Knowing that other companies would quickly hire you if you left our teal org is comforting. We see occasional outside interviewing as healthy, and encourage employees to talk with their managers about what they learn in the process. </p>
<p>While our teammates are fantastic, and we work together very well, we know we can always do better. We strive to have calm confidence, and yet yearn to improve. We are mediocre compared to how great we want to become. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#freedom-and-responsibility" id="freedom-and-responsibility">FREEDOM AND RESPONSIBILITY</a></h2>
<p>There are companies where people walk by trash on the floor in the office, waiting for someone else to pick it up, and there are companies where people lean down to pick up the trash they see, as they would at home. We try hard to be the latter, a company where everyone feels a sense of responsibility to do the right thing to help the company at every juncture. Picking up the trash is the metaphor for taking care of problems, small and large, as you see them, and never thinking “that’s not my job.” We don’t have rules about picking up the real or metaphoric trash. We try to create the sense of ownership, responsibility and initiative so that this behavior comes naturally. </p>
<p>Our goal is to inspire people more than manage them. We trust our teams to do what they think is best for our teal org — giving them lots of freedom, power, and information in support of their decisions. In turn, this generates a sense of responsibility and self-discipline that drives us to do great work that benefits the company. </p>
<p>We believe that people thrive on being trusted, on freedom, and on being able to make a difference. So we foster freedom and empowerment wherever we can. </p>
<p>In many organizations, there is an unhealthy emphasis on process and not much freedom. These organizations didn’t start that way, but became that way as they grew over time. Specifically, many organizations have freedom and responsibility when they are small. Everyone knows each other, and everyone picks up the trash. As they grow, however, the business gets more complex, and sometimes the average talent and passion level goes down. As the informal, smooth-running organization starts to break down, pockets of chaos emerge, and the general outcry is to “grow up” and add traditional management and process to reduce the chaos. As rules and procedures proliferate, the value system evolves into rule following (i.e. that is how you get rewarded). If this standard management approach is done well, then the company becomes very efficient at its business model — the system is dummy-proofed, and creative thinkers are told to stop questioning the status quo. This kind of organization is very specialized and adapted to its business model. Eventually, however, over 10 to 100 years, the business model inevitably has to change, and most of these companies are unable to adapt. </p>
<p>To avoid the rigidity of over-specialization, and avoid the chaos of growth, while retaining freedom, we work to have as simple a business as we can given our growth ambitions, and to keep employee excellence rising. We work to have a company of self-disciplined people who discover and fix issues without being told to do so. </p>
<p>We are dedicated to constantly increasing employee freedom3. Some examples of how we operate with unusual amounts of freedom are: </p>
<p>We share documents internally broadly and systematically. Nearly every document is fully open for anyone to read and comment on, and everything is cross-linked. Memos on each title’s performance, on every strategy decision, on every competitor, and on every product feature test are open for all employees to read. Despite this huge access, we’ve had very few leaks, due to our culture of self-discipline and responsibility.
There are virtually no spending controls or contract signing controls. Each employee is expected to seek advice and perspective as appropriate. “Use good judgment” is our core precept.
Our policy for travel, entertainment, gifts, and other expenses is 5 words long: “Act in our teal org’s Best Interest.” We also avoid the compliance departments that most companies have to enforce their policies.
Our vacation policy is “take vacation.” We don’t have any rules or forms around how many weeks per year. Frankly, we intermix work and personal time quite a bit, doing email at odd hours, taking off weekday afternoons for kids’ games, etc. We also don’t have a clothing policy, but no one has come to work naked; you don’t need policies for everything. Our leaders make sure they set good examples by taking vacations, often coming back with fresh ideas, and encourage the rest of the team to do the same.
Our parental leave policy is: “take care of your baby and yourself.” New parents are encouraged to take whatever time they feel is right in the first year, which they generally aren’t sure of until a few months after the baby arrives.
Each employee chooses each year how much of their compensation they want in salary versus stock options. You can choose all cash, all options, or whatever combination suits you4. You choose how much risk and upside you want. These 10-year stock options are fully-vested and you keep them even if you leave our teal org.
There are no compensation handcuffs requiring you to stay in order to get your money. People are free to leave at any time, without loss of money, and yet they generally choose to stay. We want managers to create conditions where people love being here, for the great work and great pay.</p>
<p>There are a few important exceptions to our anti-rules freedom philosophy. We are strict about ethical issues and safety issues. Harassment of employees or trading on insider information are zero tolerance issues, for example. Some information security issues, such as keeping our members’ payment information safe, have strict controls around access. Transferring large amounts of cash from our company bank accounts has strict controls. But these are edge cases. </p>
<p>In general, freedom and rapid recovery is better than trying to prevent error. We are in a creative business, not a safety-critical business. Our big threat over time is lack of innovation, so we should be relatively error tolerant. Rapid recovery is possible if people have great judgment. The seduction is that error prevention just sounds so good, even if it is often ineffective. We are always on guard if too much error prevention hinders inventive, creative work. </p>
<p>On occasion, freedom is abused. We had one senior employee who organized kick-backs on contracts for several years before being caught. But those are the exceptions, and we avoid over-correcting. Just because a few people abuse freedom doesn’t mean that our employees are not worthy of great trust. </p>
<p>Some processes are about increased productivity, rather than error avoidance, and we like process that helps us get more done. One such process we do well at is effective scheduled meetings. We have a regular cadence of many types of meetings; we start and end on time, and have well-prepared agendas. We use these meetings to learn from each other and get more done, rather than to prevent errors or approve decisions. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#informed-captains" id="informed-captains">INFORMED CAPTAINS</a></h2>
<p>For every significant decision there is a responsible captain of the ship who makes a judgment call after digesting others’ views. We avoid committees making decisions because that would slow us down, and diffuse responsibility and accountability. We “farm for dissent.” Dissent is not natural or easy, so we make a concerted effort to stimulate it. Many times, groups will meet about topics and debate them, but then afterwards someone needs to make a decision and become that “captain.” Small decisions may be shared just by email, larger ones will merit a memo with discussion of the various positions, and why the captain made such a decision. The bigger a decision, the more extensive the dissent/assent gathering should be, usually in an open shared document. We are clear, however, that decisions are not made by a majority or committee vote. We don’t wait for consensus, nor do we drive to rapid, uninformed decision making. When the captain of any particular decision is reasonably confident of the right bet for us to take, they decide and we take that bet. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#context-not-control" id="context-not-control">CONTEXT NOT CONTROL</a></h2>
<p>We want employees to be great independent decision makers, and to only consult their manager when they are unsure of the right decision. The leader’s job at every level is to set clear context so that others have the right information to make generally great decisions. We don’t buy into the lore of CEOs, or other senior leaders, who are so involved in the details that their product or service becomes amazing. The legend of Steve Jobs was that his micromanagement made the iPhone a great product. Others take it to new extremes, proudly calling themselves nano-managers. The heads of major networks and studios sometimes make many decisions in the creative process of their content. We do not emulate these top-down models because we believe we are most effective and innovative when employees own decisions. </p>
<p>We strive to develop good decision-making muscle throughout our company. We pride ourselves on how few, not how many, decisions senior management makes. We don’t want hands-off management. Each leader’s role is to teach, to set context, and to be highly informed of what is happening. The only way to figure out how the context setting needs to improve is to explore a sample of all the details. But unlike the micro-manager, the goal of knowing those details is not to change certain small decisions, but to learn how to adjust context so more decisions are made well. </p>
<p>There are some minor exceptions to “context not control,” such as an urgent situation in which there is no time to think about proper context and principles, when a new team member hasn’t yet absorbed enough context to be confident, or when it’s recognized that the wrong person is in a decision-making role. </p>
<p>We tell people not to seek to please their boss. Instead seek to serve the business. It’s OK to disagree with your manager. It’s never OK to hide anything. It’s OK to say to your manager, “I know you disagree, but I’m going to do X because I think it is a better solution. Let me know if you want to specifically override my decision.” What we don’t want is people guessing what their manager would do or want, and then executing on that decision. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#highly-aligned-loosely-coupled" id="highly-aligned-loosely-coupled">HIGHLY ALIGNED, LOOSELY COUPLED</a></h2>
<p>As companies grow, they often become highly centralized and inflexible. Symptoms include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Senior management is involved in tons of small decisions</li>
<li>There are numerous cross-departmental buy-in meetings to socialize tactics</li>
<li>Pleasing other internal groups takes precedence over pleasing customers</li>
<li>The organization is highly coordinated and less prone to error, but slow and frustrating</li>
</ul>
<p>We avoid this by being highly aligned and loosely coupled. We spend lots of time debating strategy together, and then trust each other to execute on tactics without prior approvals. Often, two groups working on the same goals won’t know of, or have approval over, their peer activities. If, later, the activities don’t seem right, we have a candid discussion. We may find that the strategy was too vague or the tactics were not aligned with the agreed strategy. And we discuss generally how we can do better in the future. </p>
<p>The success of a “Highly Aligned, Loosely Coupled” work environment is dependent upon the collaborative efforts of high performance individuals and effective context. Ultimately, the end goal is to grow the business for bigger impact while increasing flexibility and agility. We seek to be big, fast, and nimble. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#seeking-excellence" id="seeking-excellence">SEEKING EXCELLENCE</a></h2>
<p>New employees often comment in the first few months that they are surprised how accurate our culture description is to the actual culture they experience. Around the world, we live and create our culture together. In fact, hundreds of global employees contributed to this document. </p>
<p>We do not seek to preserve our culture — we seek to improve it. Every person who joins us helps to shape and evolve the culture further. We find new ways to accomplish more together. Every few years we can feel a real difference in how much more effectively we are operating than in the past. We are learning faster than ever because we have more dedicated people with diverse perspectives trying to find better ways for our talented team to work together more cohesively, nimbly, and effectively. </p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>As founder I have 3 years of initial benefit at experience level 4 and P2P efficiency 4
means I start with <code>100% * 4 * 4 * 3 *12 * 1 = 576 points</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The company gets exit after 3 years from now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I stay on same levels this gives me an additional 576 points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A developer only worked 2 years for company. P2P efficiency=2, experience=2, country Europe:  <code>100%*2*2*2*12*1=96 points</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At exit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Founder = 		1152 points</li>
<li>Developer = 		96 points</li>
<li>Rest of team = 	6000 points</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p>Means </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Founder gets 1152/7248 = 16% of proceeds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developer gets 96/7248 = 1.3% of proceeds</p>

<ul>
<li>Bonus is collected by a point system,
<ul>
<li>Points are given on a quarterly basis</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We call each point a BonusToken</li>
<li>Goal is to keep it very simple yet as fair as possible</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Promote Teamwork = common goals for everyone</li>
<li>A living mechanism (flexibility)</li>
<li>Be more fair and easy to manage compared to classic stock option plan.</li>
<li>Allow for someone not to be functioning at 200% all the time, 
maybe some less productive period can &amp; should be possible.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#how" id="how">How</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Everyone can earn points per month</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Points are calculated as follows</p>
<ul>
<li>p2p_level x % fulltime x country_index x contribution_level x 1,000</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The contribution_level is defined by the remuneration committee at hiring but also later on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="header" href="#contribution_level" id="contribution_level">contribution_level</a></h3>
<p><strong>The remuneration committee</strong> does not take the following parameters in consideration**</p>
<ul>
<li>Seniority: how long are you working for one of our companies</li>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Title</li>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>Location (where do you live/work)</li>
<li>Education</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, nothing to do with grades or history !!! This is very different compared to a hierarchical company.</p>
<p><strong>The remuneration committee evaluation will be based upon:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>contribution_level is rewarded at hiring time and are between 1 and 5.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At Hiring</p>
<ul>
<li>Based on experience and predicted level for the future </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>After Hiring</p>
<ul>
<li>Once a year at least, the remuneration committee will review if the contribution_level is in line with expectations.</li>
<li>The contribution_level is a combination of many parameters some examples
<ul>
<li>Some extra special efforts done which had benefit for our group</li>
<li>Projects delivered</li>
<li>Funding found</li>
<li>Product created and important for the company (ownership)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The contribution_level can be changed by the remuneration committee if that would be required. Of course proper communication happens with the contributor.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Who is part of the remuneration committee</strong></p>
<p>Is different per organization. Please ask the company you work for.</p>
<p><strong>Contribution Level Score</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1: the default (most people will be here)</li>
<li>2: senior experience, very good in job</li>
<li>3: Super experience, few can do what you do.</li>
<li>4: exceptional, from experience &amp; contribution level. Super strategic for the company.</li>
<li>5: absolutely exceptional, almost no-one can be here.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="header" href="#peer2peer-awarenesslevel--p2p-efficiency" id="peer2peer-awarenesslevel--p2p-efficiency">Peer2Peer AwarenessLevel = P2P Efficiency</a></h3>
<p>It has to do with capabilities we achieve in line of working with a circle based organization.</p>
<p>Levels can be found in:</p>
<p><a href="docs/collaboration/freeflow_collaboration//collaboration/p2p_awareness_level.html">Peer2Peer Awareness Level</a></p>

<li>Pup = 1</li>
<li>Wolf = 2</li>
<li>Elephant = 4</li>
<li>Dolphin = 5</li>
<li>Eagle = NA today</li>

<p>At least once a year this needs to be reviewed, but much more is better.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#how-to-deal-with-history" id="how-to-deal-with-history">How to deal with history</a></h3>
<p>When bonus token plan starts the remuneration committee looks at history and starts with a pre-set amount of points.</p>
<p>Max nr of months = 48 to take into consideration</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#how-do-we-want-to-use-a-blockchain" id="how-do-we-want-to-use-a-blockchain">How do we want to use a blockchain</a></h2>
<p>These points will be registered on a blockchain &amp; will be a separate token in your wallet.</p>
<p>How (detailed, not important to understand now):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Each quarter people get their collected tokens = BonusTokens in their wallet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tokens can be exchanged on Decentralized Exchange.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each exit the value of the bonus pool goes up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Bonus Pool org will sell tokens at the following price</p>
<ul>
<li>Value of pool / nr of tokens</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foundation Pool Value = sum of all assets which are liquid</p>
<ul>
<li>E.g. Liquid tokens e.g. TFT</li>
<li>E.g. Money e.g. as result of exit of a company</li>
<li>E.g. Gold</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once people sold tokens to Bonus Pool, the tokens get destroyed, so fewer tokens available to distribute when people step out.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="header" href="#exit-value-at-any-time-" id="exit-value-at-any-time-">Exit value at any time =</a></h3>
<p>Value of bonus pool at start = 0$</p>
<p>At any time there is an exit the value is added to the bonus pool.</p>
<p>The bonus pool is combination of </p>
<ul>
<li>cash e.g. exit of a company</li>
<li>tokens e.g. TFT’s in liquid form</li>
<li>Shares of other public company's e.g. if we did an IPO</li>
</ul>
<p>The value of a BonusToken is</p>
<ul>
<li>total value pool/nr of BonusToken in pool</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone can sell BonusTokens to the pool at any point in time at the calculated value above, if enough liquidities are available.</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The pool keeps on rising in value over time e.g. share on IPO, TFT, sell 1 more company…</li>
<li>So BonusToken’s can/will go up in value in relation to value created.</li>
<li>Everyone chooses when to sell BonusToken’s or not, it's basically a transaction on our own decentralized exchange from BonusToken to GoldToken.</li>

<h3><a class="header" href="#levels-of-coordination" id="levels-of-coordination">levels of coordination</a></h3>
<h3><a class="header" href="#circle-coordinator" id="circle-coordinator">Circle Coordinator</a></h3>
<p>Coordinates (helps) a team of people working on one or more stories and ensures that:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a circle home page with updated information (wiki part of circles tool)</li>
<li>All members understand our Agile principles of working together</li>
<li>All members find their way into our community &amp; our tools &amp; information</li>
<li>All members are happy to contribute and are motivated/passionate</li>
<li>Is able to eliminate the blockages that circle members might experience</li>
</ul>
<p>Circle Coordinators are often also story owners (of X nr of stories)</p>
<p>A Circle Coordinator is not a controller! It's a person at service of his or her team. </p>
<ul>
<li>Coordinators manage circles.</li>
<li>A circle is a group of people working together around a set of specific topics.</li>
<li>A coordinator in an agile organization does not control, has no decision power.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's the reverse of an authoritative, or autocratic power play. A coordinator does not command or take decisions. Decisions happen automatically because an agile process is being followed. A coordinator makes sure others can easily contribute and they can find all the information they require, they discover and clear road-blocks and make it possible for people to be their best, its about getting the process to work smoothly without being in the way.</p>
<p>A coordinator:</p>
<ul>
<li>is at service of the circle or the larger community they work for</li>
<li>makes sure that:
<ul>
<li>every contributor of the circle understands and follows the agile principles and becomes a good contributor</li>
<li>the mission or strategy of the circle is known &amp; understood - documentation e.g. a wiki is ideal</li>
<li>the goals are translated into achieveable work and this happens by means of <a href="docs/collaboration/freeflow_collaboration//collaboration/stories.html">stories</a></li>
<li>quality <a href="docs/collaboration/freeflow_collaboration//collaboration/stories.html">stories</a> are created (well explained, done is done, requirements known, a story is not a task)</li>
<li>stakeholders have input on the stories and they can follow progress</li>
<li>story owner's (people who own a specific story) can do their duty (keep to time, have the resources they need, know the specific goal of the story, know who and how to escalate to, make use of comments to clearly track progress)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>is a teacher or coach
<ul>
<li>they get alongside people and help them be their best</li>
<li>they help people to become a better contributor</li>
<li>are able to explain why agile principles work so well within an organization like ours</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My personal estimate is that less than 1% of existing professionals have the skill to be a good Circle Coordinator, its not an easy job.</p>

<p>We have re-packaged some open source tools to make it easy for working with the tools &amp; formats as described above.</p>
<p>This package can be installed very easily and is supported by our engineers.</p>
<p>These tools are originally developed by developers for developers and as such they will have a learning curve to get started.</p>
<p>Once you reached a certain technical level you will be amazed to see how good your productivity will be. Anyone should be able to work with these tools in couple of days and while intimidating at first it will be much more easy afterwards and we are sure you will be thrilled by the advantages &amp; productivity boost.</p>
<p>We will be constantly working on improving this toolset, it will become easier as we go.</p>
<p>The chosen components work cross platform and are free.</p>

<ul>
<li>Clarity, Traceability, Transparency and Active Teamwork.
<ul>
<li>Clarity: try to ensure that your communications are clear, understandable, well written and purposeful.</li>
<li>Traceability: we are a complex organisation attempting something amazing, it is important we can work out who contributed what and when so we can come back to them for clarification if needed!</li>
<li>Transparency: we are open communicators, we want to be brave enough to share the good, the bad and the ugly. To be honest with each other, without being unkind. To celebrate with each other whole-heartedly when we succeed.</li>
<li>Active Teamwork: every tool is there for us to take focused action towards our common goals. Use them to help the team move forward towards completed work as efficiently and effectively as you can.</li>

<p><img src="docs/collaboration/freeflow_tools/images/gdrive_circles.png" alt="" /></p>
<ul>
<li>All non-wiki docs need to go to the correct shared folder on Google Drive.</li>
<li>Do not keep docs which will be shared with other people in your own drive.
<ul>
<li>Create the doc directly in the correct folder on the shared drive, this ensures that everyone who has access to that folder can follow the progress of all files in that folder.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Edit directly in Google Docs. Do not import from other formats, or export and import. It is really hard to stop this introducing all kinds of awful formatting which can cause pain and wasted time later on.</li>
<li>When creating presentations: use master slides &amp; link them to the presentations used within the community.</li>
<li>Use the comment feature (ctrl/cmd+alt+m) to collaborate with each other. If you use +username, it will automatically assign the comment to the person and email them.</li>
<li>Everyone contributing more than a couple of hours per month should have a gmail account in our organization within our incubaid.com Gsuite domain.
<ul>
<li>Ask for an account on an appropriate domain name.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Practice good file hygiene. Use <code>_archive/_beta</code> folders in each drive to organise docs, only ACTIVE content should be in the standard folders. </li>

<p><img src="docs/collaboration/agileprinciples/agile_team_kids.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Agile principles are a way how work cam be organized, originally it was mainly done for code collaboration, but we believe it can be easily adjusted to any team working together in an organization.</p>
<p>We found following principles on the internet and liked them so much we have adjusted them slightly and published them here. Original content from <a href="https://www.101ways.com/category/10-key-principles-of-agile/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Agile collaboration relies on close cooperation between all team members and stakeholders.</p>
<p>Agile principles include keeping requirements and documentation lightweight, and acknowledging that change is a normal.</p>
<p>This makes close collaboration particularly important to clarify requirements just-in-time and to keep all team members (including the story owner) ‘on the same page’ throughout the collaboration.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer/stakeholder through early and continuous delivery of results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Welcome changing requirements, even late in process. Agile processes harness change for the stakeholders competitive advantage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deliver results frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Business/Stakeholders and Scrum Team Members must work together very often throughout the project. This requires full transparency and communication (e.g. comments in story cards)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scrum Team members value respect more than any other value. Respect for stakeholders, team members, ... Mistakes are normal and an expected step in the process. Members need to help each other where possible. Respect also means communicate enough (tangible, so it can be followed by others easily)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a scrum team is face-to-face (zoom) conversation. BUT remember, there can be many others who want to have this information too. Specs and docs belong in the EE. Comments on stories a very good way to document process and communicate with all stakeholders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Results is the primary measure of progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agile processes promote sustainable collaboration. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#agile-requirements" id="agile-requirements">Agile Requirements</a></h2>
<p>Agile collaboration teams capture requirements at a high level.</p>
<p>Agile collaboration can be mistaken by some as meaning there’s no process; you just make things up as you go along! That approach is not so much Agile but Fragile!</p>
<p>Although Agile collaboration is much more flexible than more traditional collaboration methodologies, Agile collaboration does nevertheless have quite a bit of rigour and is based on the fairly structured approach of lean manufacturing as pioneered by Toyota.</p>
<p>We believe Agile collaboration teams can build better products/services if they have a reasonably clear idea of the overall requirements before setting out on collaboration, so that incorrect design decisions don’t lead the team down dead ends and also so a sensible investment case can be made to get the project funded.</p>
<p>However any requirements captured at the outset should be captured at a high level. At this stage, requirements should be understood enough to determine the outline scope of the product and produce high level budgetary estimates and no more.</p>
<p>Big spec up-front is not the way to go, its not in line with the 20-80% rule.
Also big up-front specs are never up to date when work is being done.
There is no lengthy requirements document or specification unless there is an area of complexity that really needs it. </p>
<p>This is a big contrast to a common situation where the business owner sends numerous new and changed requirements by email and/or verbally, somehow expecting the new and existing features to still be delivered in the original timeframes. Traditional project teams that don’t control changes can end up with the dreaded scope creep, one of the most common reasons for software collaboration projects to fail.</p>
<p>Agile teams, by contrast, accept change; in fact they expect it. But they manage change by fixing the timescales and trading-off features.</p>
<p>Stories can of course be backed up by documentation as appropriate, but always the principle of agile collaboration is to document the bare minimum amount of information that will allow a feature to be developed.</p>
<p>Using the Scrum agile management practice, requirements (or features or stories, whatever language you prefer to use) are broken down into tasks of no more than 16 hours (i.e. 2 working days) and preferably no more than 8 hours, so progress can be measured objectively on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Make sure all items (requirements) are deliverables rather than activities or tasks. You can see a deliverable and “kick the tyres”, in order to judge its quality and completeness. A task you cannot.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#change-is-not-bad" id="change-is-not-bad">Change Is Not Bad</a></h2>
<p>This is in stark contrast to a traditional collaboration project, where one of the earliest goals is to capture all known requirements and baseline the scope so that any other changes are subject to change control.</p>
<p>Traditionally, users are educated that it’s much more expensive to change or add requirements during or after the software is built. Some organisations quote some impressive statistics designed to frighten users into freezing the scope. The result: It becomes imperative to include everything they can think of – in fact everything they ever dreamed of! And what’s more, it’s all important for the first release, because we all know Phase 2’s are invariably hard to get approved once 80% of the benefits have been realised from Phase 1.</p>
<p>Ironically, users may actually use only a tiny proportion of required work, perhaps as low as 20% or less, yet many projects start life with a bloated scope. In part, this is because no-one is really sure at the outset which 20% of the product their users will actually use. Equally, even if the requirements are carefully analysed and prioritised, it is impossible to think of everything, things change, and things are understood differently by different people.</p>
<p>Agile collaboration works on a completely different premise. Agile collaboration works on the premise that requirements emerge and evolve, and that however much analysis and design you do, this will always be the case because you cannot really know for sure what you want until you see and use the software. And in the time you would have spent analysing and reviewing requirements and designing a solution, external conditions could also have changed.</p>
<p>So if you believe that point – that no-one can really know what the right solution is at the outset when the requirements are written – it’s inherently difficult, perhaps even practically impossible, to build the right solution using a traditional approach to software collaboration.</p>
<p>Traditional projects fight change, with change control processes designed to minimise and resist change wherever possible. By contrast, Agile collaboration projects accept change; in fact they expect it. Because the only thing that’s certain in life is change.</p>
<p>There are different mechanisms in Agile collaboration to handle this reality. In Agile collaboration projects, requirements are allowed to evolve, but the timescale is fixed. So to include a new requirement, or to change a requirement, the user or product owner must remove a comparable amount of work from the project in order to accommodate the change.</p>
<p>So what does the business expect from its collaboration teams? Deliver the agreed business requirements, on time and within budget, and of course to an acceptable quality. All project management professionals will be well aware that you cannot realistically fix all of these factors and expect to meet expectations. Something must be variable in order for the project to succeed. In Agile collaboration, it is always the scope (or features of the product) that are variable, not the cost and timescale.</p>
<p>Although the scope of an Agile collaboration project is variable, it is acknowledged that only a fraction of any product/project is really used by its users and therefore that not all features of a product are really essential. For this philosophy to work, it’s imperative to start collaboration (dependencies permitting) with the core, highest priority features, making sure they are delivered in the earliest iterations.</p>
<p>Unlike most collaboration projects, the result is that the business has a fixed budget, based on the resources it can afford to invest in the project, and can make plans based on a launch date that is certain.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#in-agile-collaboration-done-should-really-mean-done" id="in-agile-collaboration-done-should-really-mean-done">In agile collaboration, “done” should really mean “DONE!”.</a></h2>
<p>Features developed within an iteration (Milestone in our process), should be 100% complete by the end of the Sprint.</p>
<p>Stories on fixed should be 100% done.</p>
<p>Too often in collaboration projects, “done” doesn’t really mean “DONE!”. It doesn’t mean verified. It doesn’t necessarily mean styled. And it certainly doesn’t usually mean accepted by the product owner. It just means the bare minimum was done. 
THIS IS NOT GOOD!!!</p>
<p>In an ideal situation, each iteration or milestone should lead to a release of a milestone in a project or product. On projects maybe it’s not feasible to do a release after every milestone, however completing each feature in turn enables a very precise view of progress and how far complete the overall project really is or isn’t.</p>
<p>So, in agile collaboration, make sure that each feature is fully developed, tested, styled, and accepted by the product owner before counting it as “DONE!”. And if there’s any doubt about what activities should or shouldn’t be completed within the Sprint for each feature, “DONE!” should mean ready to be used with defined quality level.</p>
<p>The feature may rely on other features being completed before the product could really be shipped. But the feature on its own merit should be shippable. So if you’re ever unsure if a feature is ‘done enough’, ask one simple question: “Is this feature ready to be used?”.</p>
<p>It’s also important to really complete each feature before moving on to the next…</p>
<p>Of course multiple features can be developed in parallel in a team situation. But within the work of each contributor, do not move on to a new feature until the last one is verified. This is important to ensure the overall product is in a ready state at the end of the Sprint, not in a state where multiple features are 90% complete or untested, as is more usual in traditional collaboration projects.</p>
<p>In agile collaboration, “done” really should mean “DONE!“.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#fast-but-not-so-furious" id="fast-but-not-so-furious">Fast But Not So Furious</a></h2>
<p>Agile collaboration is all about frequent delivery of projects. In a truly agile world, gone are the days of the 12 month project. In an agile world, a 1-6 month project is strategic!</p>
<p>Nowhere is this more true than on the web. The web is a fast moving place. And with the luxury of centrally hosted solutions, there’s every opportunity to break what would have traditionally been a project into a list of features, and deliver incrementally on a very regular basis – ideally even feature by feature.</p>
<p>On the web, it’s increasingly accepted for products/projects to be released early (when they’re basic, not when they’re faulty!). Particularly in the Web 2.0 world, it’s a kind of perpetual beta. In this situation, why wouldn’t you want to derive some benefits early? Why wouldn’t you want to hear real user/customer feedback before you build ‘everything’? Why wouldn’t you want to look at your web metrics and see what works, and what doesn’t, before building ‘everything’?</p>
<p>And this is only really possible due to some of the other important principles of agile collaboration. The iterative approach, requirements being lightweight and captured just-in-time, being feature-driven, testing integrated throughout the lifecycle, and so on.</p>
<p>So how frequent is <em>frequent</em>?</p>
<p>Scrum says break things into 30 day Sprints. That’s certainly frequent compared to most traditional collaboration projects. We break things up in milestones which also happen each couple of weeks, it has the same goal as classic scrum.</p>
<p>30 days is a lifetime!</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#how-do-you-eat-an-elephant-one-bite-at-a-time" id="how-do-you-eat-an-elephant-one-bite-at-a-time">How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time!</a></h2>
<p>Likewise, agile collaboration projects are delivered in small bite-sized pieces, delivering small, incremental <em>releases</em> and iterating (we call them milestones which do consist out of X stories).</p>
<p>In more traditional collaboration projects, the (simplified) lifecycle is Analyse, Develop, Test – first gathering all known requirements for the whole product, then developing all elements of the project, then testing that the entire product/project is fit for release.
In agile collaboration, the cycle is Analyse, Develop, Test; Analyse, Develop, Test; and so on… doing each step for each feature, one feature at a time.</p>
<p>Advantages of this iterative approach to software collaboration include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced risk: clear visibility of what’s completed to date throughout a project</li>
<li>Increased value: delivering some benefits early; being able to release the product whenever it’s deemed good enough, rather than having to wait for all intended features to be ready</li>
<li>More flexibility/agility: can choose to change direction or adapt the next iterations based on actually seeing the result and how people appreciate it or not.</li>
<li>Better cost management: if, like all-too-many collaboration projects, you run over budget, some value can still be realised; you don’t have to scrap the whole thing if you run short of funds</li>
</ul>
<p>For this approach to be practical, each feature must be fully developed, to the extent that it’s ready to be released, before moving on.</p>
<p>Another practicality is to make sure features are developed in <em>priority</em> order, not necessarily in a logical order by function. Otherwise you could run out of time, having built some of the less important features – as in agile software collaboration, the timescales are fixed.</p>
<p>Building the features of the project ”broad but shallow” is also advisable for the same reason. Only when you’ve completed all your must-have features, move on to the should-haves, and only then move on to the could-haves. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#80-rule" id="80-rule">80% rule</a></h2>
<p>Pareto’s law is more commonly known as the 80/20 rule. The theory is about the law of distribution and how many things have a similar distribution curve. This means that <em>typically</em> 80% of your results may actually come from only 20% of your efforts!</p>
<p>Pareto’s law can be seen in many situations – not literally 80/20 but certainly the principle that the majority of your results will often come from the minority of your efforts.</p>
<p>So the really smart people are the people who can see (up-front without the benefit of hind-sight) <em>which</em> 20% to focus on.  In agile collaboration, we should try to apply the 80/20 rule, seeking to focus on the important 20% of effort that gets the majority of the results.</p>
<p>If the quality of your project/product isn’t life-threatening, if you have control over the scope, and if speed-to-market is of primary importance, why not seek to deliver the important 80% of your product in just 20% of the time? In fact, in that particular scenario, you could ask why you would ever bother doing the last 20%?</p>
<p>Now that doesn’t mean your product/project should be fundamentally flawed, a bad user experience, or full of faults. It just means that developing some features, or the richness of some features, is going the extra mile and has a diminishing return that may not be worthwhile.</p>
<p>So does that statement conflict with my other recent post: “done means DONE!”? Not really. Because within each Sprint or iteration, what you <em>do</em> choose to develop <em>does</em> need to be 100% complete within the iteration.</p>
<p>It’s also worth considering the impact on user experience. Google has shown us that users often prefer apps that do just what you want. That’s <em>just</em> what you want. And no more. The rest is arguably clutter and actually interferes with the user experience for only a limited benefit to a limited set of users.</p>
<p>So in an agile collaboration world, when you’re developing a brand new product, think very hard about what your app is <em>really</em> all about. Could you take it to market with all the important features, or with features that are less functionally rich, in a fraction of the time?</p>
<p>Apart from reduced cost, reduced risk and higher benefits by being quicker to market, you also get to build on the first release of the product based on real customer feedback.</p>
<p>So all of this is really common sense I suppose. But it’s amazing how often collaboration teams, with all the right intentions, over-engineer their solution. Either technically, or functionally, or both.</p>
<p>The really tough question, however, is can you see up-front <em>which</em> 20% is the important 20%? – the 20% that will deliver 80% of the results. In very many cases, the answer sadly is no.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#agile-collaboration-teams-must-be-empowered" id="agile-collaboration-teams-must-be-empowered">Agile collaboration Teams Must Be Empowered</a></h2>
<p>An agile collaboration team must include all the necessary team members to make decisions, and make them on a timely basis.</p>
<p>Active user involvement is one of the key principles to enable this, so the user or user representative from the business must be closely involved on a daily basis.</p>
<p>The project team must be empowered to make decisions in order to ensure that it is their responsibility to deliver the product and that they have complete ownership. </p>
<p>The team must establish and clarify the requirements together, prioritise them together, agree to the tasks required to deliver them together, and estimate the effort involved together.</p>
<p>It may seem expedient to skip this level of team involvement at the beginning. It’s tempting to get a subset of the team to do this (maybe just the product owner and analyst), because it’s much more efficient. Somehow we’ve all been trained over the years that we must be 100% efficient (or more!) and having the whole team involved in these kick-off steps seems a very expensive way to do things.</p>
<p>It ensures the buy-in and commitment from the entire project team from the outset; something that later pays dividends. When challenges arise throughout the project, the team feels a real sense of ownership. And then it’s doesn’t seem so expensive.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#active-user-involvement" id="active-user-involvement">Active user involvement.</a></h2>
<p>It’s not always possible to have users (community) directly involved in collaboration projects, particularly if the agile collaboration project is to build a product where the real end users will be external customers or consumers.</p>
<p>In this event it is imperative to have a senior and experienced user representative involved throughout.</p>
<p>A User are people who will use the product/service/content.</p>
<p>Not convinced? Here’s 16 reasons why!</p>
<ul>
<li>Requirements are clearly communicated and understood (at a high level) at the outset</li>
<li>Requirements are prioritised appropriately based on the needs of the user and market</li>
<li>Requirements can be clarified on a daily basis with the entire project team, rather than resorting to lengthy documents that aren’t read or are misunderstood</li>
<li>Emerging requirements can be factored into the collaboration schedule as appropriate with the impact and trade-off decisions clearly understood</li>
<li>The right product is delivered</li>
<li>As iterations of the product are delivered, that the product meets user expectations</li>
<li>The product is more intuitive and easy to use</li>
<li>The user/business is seen to be interested in the collaboration on a daily basis</li>
<li>The user/business sees the commitment of the team</li>
<li>contributors are accountable, sharing progress openly with the user/business every day</li>
<li>There is complete transparency as there is nothing to hide</li>
<li>The user/business shares responsibility for issues arising in collaboration; it’s not a customer-supplier relationship but a joint team effort</li>
<li>Timely decisions can be made, about features, priorities, issues, and when the product is ready</li>
<li>Responsibility is shared; the team is responsible together for delivery of the product</li>
<li>Individuals are accountable, reporting for themselves in daily updates that involve the user/business
When the going gets tough, the whole team – business and technical – work together!</li>

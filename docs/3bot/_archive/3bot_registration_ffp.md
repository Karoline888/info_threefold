## Register for FFP using 3Bot login

Sign up for [FreeFlowPages](https://freeflowpages.com), a decentralized, private and open source social space where you own and control your privacy & personal data. 
You can invite, share photos and updates with people you know, as well as join private permissioned social spaces, or create your own space for your project, group of friends, initiative or company! And remember, there are no ads, and you have full data ownership!

## Why should I use the 3Bot application for decentralized login? 

The 3Bot login is a passwordless and fully secure system. Not a single person in the world will be able to login to your account (not even us). Please choose a name, which will later be the address of your digital avatar on the web.

If you have an Android, you can do the entire registration on your phone. Just follow the instructions from your smartphone’s browser, and it will prompt you to download the app and open it when needed.  There is a video below with all the steps!

If you want to open FreeFlowPages on your computer, you will need to download the 3Bot App on your smartphone (either IOS or Android) and use both devices to complete the process.

We are still working on the registration for FreeFlowPages using only an iPhone, we will update you when it’s ready!

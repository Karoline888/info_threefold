# ThreeFold Tokenomics
## Earning Tokens: Farming

When a person puts capacity on the ThreeFold Grid, this process is called Farming. To incentivize farming, the farmer will be remunerated a certain amount of tokens for doing so. The number of tokens is dependent on multiple factors.

## Earning Tokens: Cultivating

Users of the Grid will purchase capacity from the Farmer who has made this capacity available on the ThreeFold Grid. This payment for the capacity will be made in ThreeFold Tokens. 

# Maximum Tokens in Circulation

## Burning

To ensure an incentivized model for all stakeholders in the ecosystem, there is a 2 billion cap on the maximum amount of ThreeFold Token in circulation at all times. We do this by what they call "burning of tokens". 

This means that of each transaction made in order to reserve capacity 50% of the tokens will be burned. (transactions that are made to other wallets, exchanges, etc are not subject to the burning of tokens).

E.g. a farmer asks 100 TFT for a certain amount of capacity + timeframe. The user of this capacity will pay the full 100 TFT. Yet the farmer will only receive a % of this amount.

As 50% is burned off, and part of the transaction also goes to the ThreeFold Foundation.

The number that goes to the ThreeFold Foundation will decrease over time.

## Difficulty level

As mentioned in the farming section of this wiki entry, the amount of farmed tokens a farmer receives when putting capacity online is subject to changing factors. One of those is the difficulty level. This difficulty level is there to ensure there wonâ€™t be an over supply of tokens/nor capacity. 

## An Inclusive Market

The market for farming, cultivating and trading is open to all. If one has an internet connection and a power outlet he/she can become a farmer, cultivate capacity and trade ThreeFold Tokens.

## The Valuation Of The Grid

Our pricing for storage and compute capacity in the simulation are very low compared to other cloud offerings in the current market.

**Compute unit: 4 GB memory & 2 virtual CPU **

    *  TF Simulation price = 8 USD

    *  Market price = between 40 USD and 120 USD

**Storage unit: 1TB of netto usable storage = 5 USD**

* TF Simulation price = 5 USD

* Market price = between 20 USD and 120 USD

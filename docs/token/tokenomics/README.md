# ThreeFold Tokenomics

The ThreeFold Token is developed in a way that it incentivizes the growth of the ThreeFold Grid. 
Each farmer has two streams of TFT income:


## Earning Tokens: Farming

*** Proof-Of-Capacity ***
When a person puts capacity on the ThreeFold Grid, this process is called Farming. To incentivize farming, the farmer will be remunerated a certain amount of tokens for doing so. 
The number of tokens the farmer earns is dependent on multiple factors:


 *Server/Node Specs*

* Compute Capacity (CPU)

* Memory Capacity (RAM)

* Storage Capacity (SSD/HDD)



*Grid Specs (this is the same for all farmers at every point in time)*

* Farming Difficulty (the actual difficulty factor determining how fast TFT’s are created through farming)

Learn more about this below at difficulty level or in our [simulator section](/token/tokenomics/simulations.md).

## Earning Tokens: Cultivation

Anyone can run applications and workloads on top of the ThreeFold Grid. Capacity can be reserved from the Farmer who has made this capacity available on the ThreeFold Grid. This payment for capacity will be made in ThreeFold Tokens. Cultivation incentivizes farmers to create capacity where it is needed most by rewarding them when that capacity is used.

## Support of the ThreeFold Foundation

In order to promote the growth and development of the ThreeFold Grid, a percentage of all cultivation transactions goes to the ThreeFold Foundation.
This percentage equals 10% at the moment. After 24 months of farming, it will go down to 5%.


# Maximum Tokens in Circulation

To maximize the value of the ThreeFold Token for all tokenholders, there is a 2 billion cap on the maximum amount of ThreeFold Token in circulation at all times.

## Burning

50% of the tokens for each cultivation transaction will be burned. That means only the transactions where capacity users pay farmers for that capacity. Transactions that are made to other wallets, exchanges, etc are not subject to the burning of tokens.

E.g. a farmer asks 100 TFT for a certain amount of capacity + timeframe. The user of this capacity will pay the full 100 TFT. Yet the farmer will only receive 40% of this amount, as 50% is burned off, and 10% of the transaction also goes to the ThreeFold Foundation*.

*after 24 months of farming it will only be 5%




## Difficulty level

As mentioned in the farming section of this wiki entry, the amount of farmed tokens a Farmer receives when putting capacity online is subject to the difficulty level. This difficulty level is there to ensure there won’t be an over supply of tokens nor capacity. The more ThreeFold Tokens exist, the fewer Tokens are distributed through Farming. The burning mechanism ensures the difficulty level does not stay at a level where it's not profitable to farm. 

## An Inclusive Market

The market for farming, cultivating and trading is open to all. If one has an internet connection and a power outlet he/she can become a farmer, cultivate capacity and trade ThreeFold Tokens. Third party exchanges ensure that ThreeFold Tokens can be exchanged between farmers and capacity users. 

## The Valuation Of The Grid

Each ThreeFold Token is tied to underlying capacity. The valuation of the total capacity of the ThreeFold Grid, gives an indication of the value of all ThreeFold Tokens in circulation. 

To evaluate the storage and compute capacity of the ThreeFold Grid, we use very low pricing compared to other cloud offerings in the current market.

**Compute unit: 4 GB memory & 2 virtual CPU**

*  TF Simulation price = 8 USD
*  Market price = between 40 USD and 120 USD

**Storage unit: 1TB of netto usable storage = 5 USD**

* TF Simulation price = 5 USD
* Market price = between 20 USD and 120 USD

Based on this pricing, the growing capacity of the ThreeFold Grid could be valuated as follows. (graph)

#Tokenomics

** Overview

** Earning TFT's: Farming

** Earning TFT's: Cultivation

** Maximum of tokens in cultivation

*** Burning ***

To ensure an incentivized model for all stakeholders in the ecosystem, there is a 2 billion cap on the maximum amount of ThreeFold Token in circulation at all times. We do this by what they call “burning of tokens”. 

This means that of each transaction made in order to reserve capacity 50% of the tokens will be burned. (transactions that are made to other wallets, exchanges, etc are not subject to the burning of tokens).

E.g. a farmer asks 100 TFT for a certain amount of capacity + timeframe. The user of this capacity will pay the full 100 TFT. Yet the farmer will only receive a % of this amount.
As 50% is burned off, and part of the transaction also goes to the ThreeFold Foundation.
The number that goes to the ThreeFold Foundation will decrease over time.

*** Difficulty level ***

As mentioned in the farming section of this wiki entry, the amount of farmed tokens a farmer receives when putting capacity online is subject to changing factors. One of those is the difficulty level. This difficulty level is there to ensure there won’t be an over supply of tokens/nor capacity. 

** An inclusive market **

The market for farming, cultivating and trading is open to all. If one has an internet connection and a power outlet he/she can become a farmer, cultivate capacity and trade ThreeFold Tokens.

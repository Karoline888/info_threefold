# Increase of ThreeFold Token Value

## Question

How can the ThreeFold token price increase over time, especially if consumers decide to buy from whomever is offering the cheapest capacity?

## Answer

The value of the token will increase by the token being traded in token markets. The normal demand and supply mechanism will determine the token pricing. Supply is only driven by farmers that put capacity online and the demand is driven by a lot of different groups, e.g. people that need tokens to reserve capacity.

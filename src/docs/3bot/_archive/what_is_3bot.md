## What Is 3Bot?

YOUR DIGITAL AVATAR. YOUR DIGITAL SELF.

3Bot is your own autonomous digital avatar that acts as a digital cell which owns all of your information and can act on your behalf. 

To create this 3Bot we had no choice other than to start from scratch and re-invent a lot because existing IT components are too centralized and often too inefficient (e.g. memory hungry).

3Bot uses the resources of the TF Nodes to bring any required services to life. 

## What can 3Bot do?

3Bot has been designed to be as efficient as possible. The current memory footprint is less than 200MB yet still it is a wiki system, database, blockchain, web server, indexing & search machine, e-commerce system, wallet, decentralized exchange, and more. It can manage millions of objects and is the center of your company or your digital life.

3Bot performs specific functions to help regulate and maintain the functions of the global information system. 

3Bot empowers the Circular Decentralized Internet. 

By nature, a 3Bot is stateless (has no data storage of its own). A 3Bot owns digital currency (ThreeFold Token/TFT) which the 3Bot can use to reserve raw storage and compute resources on the grid.

Each 3Bot has a unique capability to use this CPU and storage capacity from the different TF Nodes in the TF Grid in a safe and reliable way. Data cannot be lost because of the above described dispersed storage algorithm.

A 3Bot can store a petabyte of information as long as enough TFTs are available so the required resource can be reserved on the individual TF Nodes. 3Bot is the only entity which has the required information and keys to make retrieval of the distributed data possible.

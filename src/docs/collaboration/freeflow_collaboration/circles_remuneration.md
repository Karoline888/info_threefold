# Circles Remuneration

![](images/money.png)

There are 3 ways how people can be remuneration for effort done in our P2P circular economy.
You can only fit in 1 category at the same time.

## Matchmaker (business development)

[The matchmaker remuneration simulator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UqqAsq-KREhRrxMBMPAMGL1IezabOGXVURtjGa04lDA/edit#gid=1207964356)

We make distinction between networkers and advocates. Some people take both roles and get the commission of both roles as well.

- A networker connects prospects to a project.
- An advocate can do the presentation, will follow up the full process to get the money on the bank, understands the product/service/market opportunity well. An advocate can do all presentations & calls without help of member of the project they are supporting. Only for tech and deep level business calls support can be called from the project.


## Fix member of 1 or more circles

- As a fixed member of a circle there can be a salary (optional) or payments for the contributions done.
- Circle members receive the benefits of Bonus Tokens (basically our alternative to a stock option plan)
- Circle members are serious contributors and dedicate a lot of time to the project.
- Circle members who receive remuneration or bonus tokens from a circle WILL NOT BE PART of the Matchmaker remuneration plan !

The P2P awareness level is an important factor.


## Ad hoc contributor

Ad hoc contributor.
Certain stories or circles can have a budget to reward ad hoc contributors.
They are not part of the bonus token pool

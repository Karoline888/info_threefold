All information in the world can be accessed by knowing only 2 numbers.

One number is the find which 3bot to talk to, the other number is to find the information in the 3bot of the data owner (can be a legal entity or human person).

Information can be a movie or a single piece of information like your email address.

Each 3bot is responsible for retrieving the information from the TF Nodes. This happens in a very secure way and the 3bot is the only digital entity capable of re-assembling the information in such a way it makes sense again.

This is probably the most efficient, secure and private distributed storage system ever created.

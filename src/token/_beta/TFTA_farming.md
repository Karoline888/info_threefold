## Minting update

From June onwards the (new) minting will happen on the Stellar Ntwork blockchain and no longer on Rivine.  This is a major step forward.  Also on the 1st of June we have put the TFT token on the Liquid public exchange next to the Stellar Network listing earlier in May.

These threefacts force us to consider a number of topics that are important for the minting process in the very near future.  Going concerns on the token listings:

- **Token value is important**.  
    - The listing on Liquid created a risk that (certain) token holders wanted to sell large quantities of tokens and depreciate the token value very quickly.  In order to mitigate that risk we have asked the community to agree with migrating all existing tokens from the Rivine blockchain to the Stellar network to TFTA.  TFTA are tradable on the Stellar Network, but not on the Liquick exchange.
    - The new token economy (as per the description here) pais about 3 times as much tokens on a monthly basis as the previous one.  This is no longer a constant amount, it is an amount of tokens that is dependent on the number of token in circulation.  The nearer number of tokens in circulation are towards the 4B ceiling the less tokens are minted by the same amount of capacity.
    - The number of tokens that will be accrued by farmers over the next couple of months add up to a years worth of token mintin in the old models (if the size of the grid does not masively grows).  This presents another risk where the amount of tokens that are available to be sold on the exchanges is increasing tremendously.
- **The Foudnation needs funding**.
    - The Liquid listing is done to get the

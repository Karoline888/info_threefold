## Minting update

From May period onwards the minting happens on the Stellar Network blockchain and no longer on Rivine. This is a major step forward. On 1st of June we also put the TFT on the Liquid public exchange next to the Stellar Network listing earlier in May.

These three facts force us to consider a number of topics that are important for the minting process:

**Token value is important**.  
    - The listing on Liquid created a risk that (certain) token holders are going to sell large quantities of tokens and depreciate the token value very quickly.  In order to mitigate that risk we have asked the farming and ambassador community to agree with migrating all existing tokens from the Rivine blockchain to TFTA on the Stellar Network.  TFTA’s are tradable on the Stellar Network, but not on the Liquid exchange.
    - The new token economy (as per the description https://wiki.threefold.io/#/tokenomics_updated) pays about 3 times as much tokens on a monthly basis (today) as the previous one. This is no longer a constant amount, it is an amount of tokens that is dependent on the number of tokens in circulation. The closer the number of tokens in circulation is towards the 4B ceiling the fewer tokens are minted by the same amount of capacity (monthly automatic increase of difficulty level).
    - The number of tokens that will be accrued by farmers over the next couple of months adds up to (almost) a year’s worth of token minting in the old model (if the size of the grid does not massively grow). This presents another risk where the amount of tokens that are available to be sold on the exchanges is growing immensely.

**The ThreeFold Foundation needs funding**.
The Liquid listing is done to get funding for the foundation. Funding will only go to the foundation if the foundation can sell previously minted tokens. If the market is flooded with new monthly minted tokens the foundation loses its funding capability.

Therefore we believe that the best way forward for all of us (Farmers, Token investors, the actual -TFT- token valuation) and foundation funding is to mint TFTA’s for farming activities the coming months while the Foundation maximises its funding opportunity.

Farmers will be able to farm TFT after they have completed a certification program that will commence in September.  The certification program details will be announced in the beginning of August.  All current farmers are considered to be able to certify, more stringent rules might come up after 1st of January based on community discussion and agreement. 

You can enlist now for certification.  All farmed TFTA will be converted to TFT by January 1st 2021.

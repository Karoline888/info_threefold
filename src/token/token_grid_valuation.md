# Valuation of the ThreeFold Token

The value of the ThreeFold Token is based on the economic value of the ThreeFold Grid which consists of capacity for storage and compute. This capacity is meeting one of the fastest-growing markets globally. The combined valuation of all TFT in circulation can be expressed by the demand of this market for the capacity of the ThreeFold Grid, leading to a sound and transparent method of evaluation. This is unlike most other cryptocurrencies who are deriving their market price on purely speculative value. 


## The Market
### The global cloud market is growing at an exponential rate

Various reports from reputable resources show that the global cloud market is almost doubling its revenues between 2018 and 2023. Currently (2020) it is valued at USD 249.8Bn.

### Large parts of the world still lack access to local capacity
![](./img/token_cloudstructure.jpg)
Despite the fast-growing global cloud market, the distribution of data centers is still mostly concentrated on the western world and certain parts of Asia.
This source lists the data centers of the current market leader in cloud capacity as an example:

Other market contenders data center locations are following this logic:
- [Oracle](https://blogs.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure/oracle-launches-four-new-cloud-regions-across-four-continents)
- [cloudwirx](https://www.cloudwirx.com/datacenters)
- [Microsoft](https://yellowduckguy.wordpress.com/2018/03/15/microsoft-worldwide-data-center-locations/)

This inequality of distribution can be explained by the high requirements in infrastructure, electricity and security to operate large scale data centers that often require an investment of USD 1bn+ for setup.


### Equality is suffering
This lack of access and distribution of the internet could lead to parts of the world being excluded from the internet for decades to come, as shown in [this article](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/10/universal-internet-access-unlikely-until-2050-experts-say-lack-skills-investment-slow-growth). 

### Conclusion
The current growth rates only reflect the increasing demand through IoT, AI, autonomous driving and VR in developed countries that already have access to the Internet. The industry fails to acknowledge that access to the Internet has been declared a [human right](https://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/17session/A.HRC.17.27_en.pdf). Therefore the forecasted investments need to be much higher to avoid a vast increase in the gap of global equality and fairness.


## The potential of the ThreeFold Grid
The ThreeFold Grid is designed to be peer to peer, close to the user and does not need a high-end datacenter to live in. (Learn more about the ThreeFold Grid  [here](\grid\grid.md))
This means with our technology we can bring internet capacity - compute and storage - to the 3 billion people who have no access to it so far on our planet.
Developers that deploy their applications and workloads on the ThreeFold Grid enjoy are variety of benefits like [Smart Contract for IT](capacity_layer.md), which enables blockchain-like transparency and transparency. Their users are empowered to own 100% of their data through [3bot](info_threefold\src\3bot),  another defining part of ThreeFolds technology.
These technological advantages are unique selling points that will lead to faster adoption of the ThreeFold Grid.

Considering the described global existing market, a 10% share of the current public cloud market of 500 billion USD by 2025 is realistic. 
This would translate to a demand 50 billion USD to utilize the capacity of the ThreeFold Grid. Our simulations show that this capacity requires about 75 million [3nodes](grid\types_of_capacity.md) to be deployed on the ThreeFold Grid globally. 


## The evaluation of all ThreeFold Tokens

The ThreeFold Grid can be expanded indefinitely and independent farmers are incentivized to contribute to this expansion according to the demand of the market.
The amount of TFT however, is limited to a maximum of [4 billion TFT](token\token_limitedsupply.md) that can ever be created. 

![](./img/token_issuance_economy1.png)

In the aforementioned case, global demand of 50 billion USD would meet a limited supply of TFT that can never exceed 4 billion. This would mean that each TFT would have an underlying value of 12,5 USD in capacity. 
Disclaimer: Please note that we can´t and won´t make price predictions on TFT evaluation and that all calculations made here are purely hypothetical.

In the case that ThreeFold would only achieve a 1% market share, this still would lead to an expected demand of 5 billion USD worth of capacity, about 7,5 million [3nodes] and 1,25 USD in underlying value of copacity for each TFT. 

### Sustainable growth vs hype
Market dynamics can lead to a higher valuation. Some TFT holders might not want to trade their tokens away because they expect a further increase in value. This results in a lower liquid amount of TFT meeting 5 billion USD in demand. Expectations are proven when the price increases and the valuation can enter a hype cycle that feeds into itself, leading to an economic bubble.
While this can lead to big speculative gains for some, these are always the losses of others. ThreeFold does not support speculative bubbles and the worsening in global inequality that can occur as a consequence. Therefore we wont participate in marketing activites that artificially inflate the price of TFT.
We believe in a fair evaluation of TFT from the economic demand for the capacity of the ThreeFold Grid instead.

# Why does ThreeFold need its own currency?


Every economical system can benefit from a trusted currency. For the largest parts of our everyday life, we are used to an exchange of goods and services against fiat money - meaning a centralized currency issued by a central bank. 

**So why donÂ´t we follow this convenient and familiar path for ThreeFold?**

Because the value of the ThreeFold Grid and its use-cases is largely provided by its [decentralized](true_decentralized_internet_system.md) nature. We believe in the power and autonomy of individuals that collaborate in a peer to peer system, where everyone is participating with equal privileges.

The vast [ecosystem](info_threefold\src\partners.md) that we are creating would be incomplete without a decentralized currency as a fair and trustworthy currency for all stakeholders. TFT allows our whole ecosystem to enjoy the [benefits and the fairness](token_what.md) of a decentralized currency. That is why we created the ThreeFold Token (TFT) in 2018.

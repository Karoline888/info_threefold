## FreeTFT

FreeTFT is free money that can be earned by candidate developers on the Threefold grid, which can be used for exploration of the grid without loosing money on it. There are 1000 FreeTFTs that can be requested per 3Bot ID. These FreeTFT are not paid out to farmers, but are burned during the reservation process. They are like a coupon and have no long-lasting value.

Think about FreeTFT to be like a testnet on a blockchain/

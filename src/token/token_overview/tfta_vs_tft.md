# TFTA vs TFT

## Quick history overview

- A little over 2 years ago (March 2018) our first-generation blockchain for the Threefold Token saw the daylight. 
    - The TFT v1 was launched on a blockchain called Rivine.
- A little over a year ago (Q2 2019) we launched our generation 1 of our TF Grid. 
- April 2020 we [launched our TFGrid v2.0](threefold_grid_2_0.md) which is now public and usable by the world.
    - We have a new website, a new wiki (https://wiki.threefold.io)
    - a manual on how to use the TF Grid 2.0 (see https://sdk.threefold.io).

## The Launch of our 2nd generation Token

May 2020 TFT v2 launches on the payment network called Stellar.

Stellar is a very reliable platform used by more and more projects. 

We organize a Token Distribution Event on Stellar to benefit projects which have as only purpose to provide value to the ThreeFold movement and do good for our planet. 

Upto 70m TFT are offered for sale on Stellar and later on at least 2 public exchanges. Read more about this on [our Token Distribution event page](tdeoverview.md)

We also migrate our existing TFT (ThreeFold tokens from our own blockchain called Rivine) to Stellar, our existing TFT will be called TFTA on Stellar. 

## TFTA

The TFTA has all same rights as your current TFT on Rivine, it can be transferred to anyone, it can be used to buy or sell capacity on the TFGrid.
By moving the TFT v1 to Stellar we get some additional benefits, the TFTA is tradable on Stellar decentralized exchange.

The TFTA will automatically convert to the new TFT at end of this year and you can sell your TFTA as TFT by means of the [ThreeFold market making bot](threefold_marketmaker_bot.md) starting July.

All TFTA are being transferred to Stellar on a 1-1 basis, no tokens created nor deleted, there can be some small time differences to make it practically possible e.g. 5m TFT was first created on Stellar to bootstrap which will not transfer from TFT Rivine.

## TFT

The TFT is our generation 2 token has launched natively on Stellar and is available for trading starting May 2020.
Only 73m TFT are available at launching price of USD 0.15.

Each 2nd generation TFT is a converted TFTA. The first batch as used in the [token distribution event](tdeoverview.md) was converted first. In other words TFT is nothing more or less than a TFTA with a certain time difference. Technical info about migration can be found [here](tft_tfta_migration_process_technical.md).

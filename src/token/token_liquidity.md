# The Liquidity of TFT

## Natural Economic Demand
The ThreeFold Grid is already the largest decentralized network of capacity in the world. It is attracting developers to build applications that run on its capacity. This is incentivized by many benefits that the users of these applications can enjoy: 100% ownership of their data, superior reliability through decentralized hosting, guaranteed and transparent execution of software through the [Smart Contract for IT](smart_contract_for_it.md), and many more benefits. Developers can rent capacity from the ThreeFold Grid in exchange for TFT (only; no other currencies are used) and this is what creates a natural economic demand. We call this process cultivation.

You can learn more on how to deploy applications and other workloads on the ThreeFold Grid [here](https://cloud.threefold.io/).

This [knowledge base on valuation](src\token\token_grid_valuation.md) shows how the ThreeFold Grid could grow to a 10% share of the current public cloud market. This would equal 500 billion USD by 2025 and translate to a 50 billion USD demand to utilize the capacity of the TF Grid through TFT as the medium of exchange for capacity. This 

### Stability vs Hype
Market dynamics can lead to a higher valuation. Some TFT holders might not want to trade their tokens away because they expect a further increase in value. This results in a lower liquid amount of TFT meeting 5 billion USD in demand to keep the same example as above. Expectations are proven when the price increases and the valuation can enter a hype cycle that feeds into itself, leading to an economic bubble. While this can lead to big speculative gains for some, these are always the losses of others. TF does not support speculative bubbles and the worsening in global inequalities that can occur as a consequence. Therefore we wont participate in marketing activites that artificially inflate the price of TFT. We believe in a fair evaluation of TFT from the economic demand for the capacity of the TF Grid instead.

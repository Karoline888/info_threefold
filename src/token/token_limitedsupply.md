### Limited Supply
While the ThreeFold Grid can expand, a maximum of 2 Billion TFTs can be in circulation. This limit ensures stability of value and incentivization for all stakeholders.

# Maximum Of Tokens In Circulation

### To maximize the value of the ThreeFold Token (TFT) for all token holders, there is a 2 billion cap on the maximum amount of ThreeFold Token in circulation at all times. To make sure this TFT cap is adhered, the following mechanisms have been introduced:

## Difficulty level

As mentioned in the farming section of this wiki entry, the amount of farmed tokens a Farmer receives when putting capacity online is subject to the difficulty level. This difficulty level is there to ensure there wonâ€™t be an oversupply of tokens nor capacity. The more ThreeFold Tokens exist, the fewer Tokens are distributed through Farming.

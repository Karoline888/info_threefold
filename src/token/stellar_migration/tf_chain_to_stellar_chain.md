## Option 2: You have 3Bot Connect and your tokens are there

If you have already moved from the TF App to 3Bot Connect, please follow the steps below to migrate from TF Chain to the Stellar Chain.

> Convert TFChain TFT to Stellar TFTA using 3Bot Connect App

TFChain TFTs can only be converted into Stellar TFTAs when the keys used to register these tokens on TF Chain are imported into the 3Bot Connect app. 

Once this is done, conversion is simple: close your 3Bot Connect app on your smartphone, open it again by pressing the 3Bot Connect icon, click on the Wallet tab below the screen, enter your PIN, and then the conversion process starts.

During the conversion it is important NOT to close the app. Keep in mind if there are locked tokens, it can take a while!

Once the conversion process has ended, you will arrive in the accounts overview page. Done!

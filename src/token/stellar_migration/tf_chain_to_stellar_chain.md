This document helps you to convert your TFT to from the ThreeFold proprietary rivine blockchain to the Stellar blockchain.  Depending of your current situation you have to do one, or two steps to complete this conversion.

Congratulations, you successfully migrated your wallet(s) to the 3Bot Connect app.  Now we have only one more step to finish.  Please continue with Step 2.

## Step 2:  You already have 3Bot connect, your tokens are listed in the 3Bot conenct app

As you completed step 1 (just now or a long time ago) we need you to go through the process listed below to move your tokens to the Stellar blockchain.  This step is super simple.  The migration process is built into the 3Bot connect app and only requires you to open it. The app on your phone grabs the updated software automatically and will convert the tokens for you. 

Depending on your token situation (farmer with lots of transactions, an investor with locked tokens, etc, etc) this process might take a while, this is normal, just let the process complete.


Letâ€™s start the conversion process, it  is super simple: 
- close your 3Bot Connect app on your smartphone
- open it again by clicking the 3Bot connect icon
- click on the Wallet tab below the screen

- enter your PIN 

Et voila, the conversion process starts.  As stated before depending on your token situation this process might take a while.  It is important not to close the app during conversion.

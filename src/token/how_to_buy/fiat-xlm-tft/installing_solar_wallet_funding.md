## Creating a Solar Wallet.

Step 1: Downloading your preferred choice of Solar Wallet (for this manual we are going for the desktop wallet for MacOS).  Please visit [https://solarwallet.io/](https://solarwallet.io/) to download your version of this wallet.

Step 2: Install the application, read the steps to take carefully

Step3: Creating an account.

Open the Solar and click "Add account". This will take you through the process of creating a new account or importing an already existing account.  ![image alt text](img/xlm_solar_tft_manual_image_19.png)

Recommendation:

* Always use a password to secure your account.

* **When setting up a new account you will be presented with your "secret key". Write or print this done and save it in a safe place.** This is needed for instance when your device breaks down and you wish to re-install the wallet on a new device. Losing this secret key might result in the loss of your account and the funds in it. Solar nor ThreeFold can’t reset or retrieve the secret key and both cannot be held responsible for losing funds at any time. (it’s not recommended to only keep digital copies of your secret key).

You now have an empty Solar wallet.

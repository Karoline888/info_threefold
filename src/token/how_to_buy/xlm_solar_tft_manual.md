# Buying Branded TFT

## Step 1: Going from FIAT money into digital currencies

If you are new to buying digital currencies, this step is for you as you are about to step into the world digital currencies. (excited!)

For this example we will use a well known and renowned digital currency exchange that has a gateway from FIAT to digital currencies: www.Coinbase.com

1. Create an account on the sign up page : [https://www.coinbase.com/signup](https://www.coinbase.com/signup)![image alt text](img/xlm_solar_tft_manual_image_0.png)

Make sure all information provided is correct as stated on your ID.

7. To verify your input Coinbase will need you to upload a valid ID. (these options can differ per user).

8. For uploading purposes there are 3 options; webcam, phone camera & file upload. For this example we have used the webcam option to send both the fron and back of the ID.

## Exchanging your FIAT for digital currency.

For this part of the manual we unfortunately cannot provide any screenshots other than the ones on display (Dutch Language) as this setting seems to be tied to the account holder’s nationality.

For ease of trading we are buying XLM (Stellar) tokens. This makes steps to come easier.

1. Click Trade

## Creating a Solar Wallet.

Step 1: Downloading your preferred choice of Solar Wallet (for this manual we are going for the desktop wallet for MacOS).  Please visit [https://solarwallet.io/](https://solarwallet.io/) to download your version of this wallet.

Step 2: Install the application, read the steps to take carefully

Step3: Creating an account.

Open the Solar and click "Add account". This will take you through the process of creating a new account or importing an already existing account.  ![image alt text](img/xlm_solar_tft_manual_image_19.png)

Recommendation:

* Always use a password to secure your account.

* **When setting up a new account you will be presented with your "secret key". Write or print this done and save it in a safe place.** This is needed for instance when your device breaks down and you wish to re-install the wallet on a new device. Losing this secret key might result in the loss of your account and the funds in it. Solar nor ThreeFold can’t reset or retrieve the secret key and both cannot be held responsible for losing funds at any time. (it’s not recommended to only keep digital copies of your secret key).

You now have an empty Solar wallet.

## Getting your XLM from Coinbase to Solar Wallet

1. Copy your wallet address from Solar by clicking Receive and clicking on the address or QR-code (this will copy the address onto your clipboard).

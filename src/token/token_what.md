# What are ThreeFold Tokens (TFT)?

The ThreeFold Token is the currency of the new Internet. It is a decentralized digital currency that represents  a unit of reservation of capacity (compute, storage) on the largest peer-to-peer network on earth. This new Internet is built by independent farmers, who dedicate hardware to provide the necessary storage and compute. 

You can learn more about farming [here](introduction.md). 

### Where do TFTs come from?
When farmers connect hardware to the [ThreeFold Grid](grid_what.md), they get rewarded with TFT for providing rented capacity. Note that TFTs are created only when new capacity is made available on the TF Grid - therefore when farmers connect more hardware. No tokens are created out of thin air. No centralized issuers. 

### Is there a demand for TFT?
The ThreeFold Grid is already the largest decentralized network of capacity in the world. It is attracting developers to build applications that run on its capacity. This is incentivized by many benefits that the users of these applications can enjoy: 100% ownership of their data, superior reliability through decentralized hosting, guaranteed and transparent execution of software through the [Smart Contract for IT](capacity_layer_image.md), and many more benefits. Developers can rent capacity from the ThreeFold Grid in exchange for TFT (only; no other currencies are used) and this is what creates a natural economic demand. We call this process cultivation.

### A circular token economy
The following infographic illustrates the circular economy of the ThreeFold Token. 

Note that the ThreeFold Foundation's sole purposes is to ensure the expansion of the ThreeFold Grid and its ecosystem according to it's vision and values. To fund these activites, a part of each transaction that pays TFTs for cultivation is going to the ThreeFold Foundation to finance the ThreeFold Grid's expansion and to fund projects that are believed to bring a positive human or planet impact.

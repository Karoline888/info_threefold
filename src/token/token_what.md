# What are ThreeFold Tokens (TFT)?

The ThreeFold token, is the token of the new internet. 

ThreeFold Token (TFT) is a digital currency used to sell and buy Internet services (compute, storage, and application) on the ThreeFold Grid. 

The ThreeFold Token represents a unit of reservation of autonomous Internet capacity on the TF Grid. Internet Capacity (storage, compute, network) is a high-demand market, and TFT is the medium of exchange for this commodity. TFT synergistically connects the world of internet, your digital life, cloud and blockchain to the most scalable universal substrate without compromising, performance, security and privacy.

We are truly the token of the new internet.

## Farming TFT's

ThreeFold Tokens are generated through a process called "Farming". Farming happens when active internet capacity is added to the ThreeFold Grid. Independent farmers earn ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) by providing neutral and decentralized internet capacity, thus expending the usable Grid. Therefore no central entity controls the internet.

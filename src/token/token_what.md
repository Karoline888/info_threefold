# What are ThreeFold Tokens (TFT)?

The ThreeFold Token, is the currency of the new Internet that empowers equality, autonomy and sustainability. This new Internet is built by independent farmers, who dedicate hardware to provide the necessary storage and compute. (Learn more about farmers [here](src\grid\tf_farming.md)) 


## Where do TFTs come from?
In the moment that farmers connect Hardware to the ThreeFold Grid, farmers are rewarded with ThreeFold Tokens TFT for their efforts. It is important to understand that this is the only way that TFTs are created. We call this process [farming](src\grid\tf_farming\introduction.md). 


## Is there a demand for TFT?
The ThreeFold Grid is attracting developers to build applications that run on its capacity. This is incentivized by many benefits that the users of these applications can enjoy: 100% ownership of their data, superior reliability through decentralized hosting, guaranteed and transparent execution of software through the [Smart Contract for IT](capacity_layer.md) and many more. (See how developers can deploy their applications on the ThreeFold Grid [here](https://cloud.threefold.io/))
Developers can rent capacity from the ThreeFold Grid only in exchange for TFT and this is what creates a natural economic demand. We call this process cultivation.



## Understanding the full picture
The following infographic illustrates the circular economy of the ThreeFold Token. 
Please note that the ThreeFold Foundations sole purposes lie in the expansion of the ThreeFold Grid and its ecosystem as well as developing the value of TFT. To fund these activites, a part of each transaction that pays TFTs for cultivation is going to the ThreeFold Foundation.

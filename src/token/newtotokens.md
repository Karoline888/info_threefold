# ThreeFold Token (TFT) for Beginners

While the [Token section](token.md) of this wiki is quite built out, we know that some people visiting here might not have much experience with tokens in general. So, we created a page here to answer some questions which might be coming up for you.

> Important note: TFTs are not an investment instrument.

### Is ThreeFold Token a cryptocurrency?

Yes, technically. We're a digital currency, a medium of exchange on the new internet that we're creating.

### What is the process for buying ThreeFold Tokens?

There is a process for buying *all* types of digital currencies. This isn't exclusive to the ThreeFold Token. To go from fiat currency (euros or dollars or similar) to a digital currency has specific requirements by law which mean that it takes a little bit of time, but only to get set up initially. Once you verify your identity (this process is dependent on your country of residence / origin), it's quite simple.

### Is this like Bitcoin?

In some ways yes and in other ways no. They are both digital currencies but they have different purposes and reasons for existing. There are plenty of articles out there explaining Bitcoin. As far as the ThreeFold Token goes, it exists to serve as the medium of exchange on our new internet. So if you want to buy some storage to house your photos, for example, you would be able to do that through the TFT.

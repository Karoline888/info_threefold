### Is ThreeFold Token a cryptocurrency?

Yes, technically. We're a digital currency, a medium of exchange on the new internet that we're creating.

### What is the process for buying ThreeFold Tokens?

There is a process for buying all types of digital currencies. This isn't exclusive to the ThreeFold Token. To go from fiat currency (euros or dollars or similar) to a digital currency has specific requirements by law which mean that it takes a little bit of time, but only to get set up initially. Once you verify your identity (this process is dependent on your country of residence / origin), it's quite simple.

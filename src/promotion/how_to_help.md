# How You Can Help!

Want to help spread the word but not quite sure how? Here are some recommendations:

## Share With Your Network!

We have a few places where you can find regular / updated content:

- [Website](https://www.threefold.io)
- [Facebook](https://facebook.com/ThreeFold.io)
- [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/company/threefold-foundation/)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/threefold_io) 
- [Medium](https://medium.com/threefold)
- [Announcement Telegram Group](https://t.me/threefoldnews)
- [YouTube](https://youtube.com/c/ThreeFoldFoundation)

Please follow along and feel free to share with your networks when you are inspired to do so. Remember it's always best to add some information when you share the post rather than just hitting "share now." If you don't know what we're talking about, reach out to spreadtheword@threefold.io and we'll walk you through it.

Additionally, we have [a folder in this section](threefold_content.md) with shareable content you can simply download and post on your social network or messaging platform of choice.

## Introduce Someone Specific to ThreeFold

While blasting your network might be effective, we'd really recommend thinking about who specifically in your circles would be interested in what we are building and getting in touch with them one-on-one.

We believe heavily in the network effect. Say for example that there are 2,000 people in our community. If each person introduced even just one person each week to ThreeFold, and then they did the same, we'd have 32,000 people in one month.

You know best how to get in touch with the people in your circles so we'll leave it to you. But again, we're here to help if you're stuck!

## Create Your Own Content

Feel particularly passionate about what we are doing? We'd love for you to create your content about ThreeFold. That might sound scary but it can be as simple as writing a few lines of text or recording yourself talking into the camera for a few minutes and sharing it out!

## Seeking Out New Communities

There are many groups on Facebook and LinkedIn, for example, that would and should be interested in what we are building. All it takes is a bit of digging to find them. Once you do, introduce yourself and share a bit about ThreeFold.

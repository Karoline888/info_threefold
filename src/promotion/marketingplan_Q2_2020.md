# ThreeFold Marketing in Q2 2020

We have been receiving questions about our marketing and PR efforts around the launch. Please see how we are tackling the outreach for this campaign. Note that we also are responsible for identifying and preparing consistent and relevant messaging for all these channels. Over the last months, we also launched completely new websites for threefold.io and cloud.threefold.io. We have been working under high pressure and are doing our best to make this launch a success. Thank you for your support!

## 1. Impact
There are two major audiences that we are aiming to reach with this campaign. The first is a value-driven audience around the topics of sustainability, equality and souvereignity.
The communication that we branded the current threefold.io website is backed by the integral values of ThreeFold and its ecosystem. This opens up angles for collaborations and PR that we are exploring currently.

### 1.1 Partnerships
- We are onboarding 4 more partnerships with existing communities. Stay tuned about respective announcements in the next few weeks.
- We aim to expand our collaboration with one of our existing partners.
- We have an expanding list of possible partners that we want to partner with. Our recent history shows that we are attractive for collaborations and are confident that we can expand on partnerships.

### 1.2 Blogs & News websites
- We are talking to bloggers and journalists about publications on four related channels.
### 1.3 PR
- We are supported by experienced experts with networks with journalists.
That led to five promising angles with well-known media websites that would possibly publish an article about ThreeFold or its use-cases in the next weeks.
- We are looking to onboard a reputable PR agency to further expand our approach and are talking to four candidates.

### 1.4 Podcasts
- We identified a fairly large number of podcasts with respectable audiences that we are now approaching about interaction. That may be in the form of organic coverage or sponsorships.

## 2. Crypto
This audience has already invested in cryptocurrencies before. It is tech-savvy and can see the advantages of our technology. Even though it seems like a natural match, ThreeFold is not an ICO/STO or comparable to those. We are defined and driven by our values at the core. It goes without saying that pump&dump or the generation of unhealthy hype is not what we are trying to achieve here.

### 2.1 Partnerships
The technological possibilities of the ThreeFold Grid lead to many promising partnerships that are all in different phases of onboarding. 
- Among the Blockchains that we are talking to are several of the top20 in market capitalization.
- Even more are in the top 70 in market capitalization. Many of those have communities with more than 50.000 members.

### 2.2 Social Media Channels
- We are keeping our audience updated, are expanding our networks and with that, the number of shares for our content.
- We are doing regular community Zoom calls
### 2.3 Influencers	
- We are talking to two major influencers on Youtube
One of them is already confirmed and will be announced soon
- We are receiving organic requests from reputable advisors on from the crypto space. Each one of them has to be checked thoroughly if there is an alignment with our values and vision.

### 2.4 Top Exchange Partner
- We are launching on a big crypto exchange that will assist us by reaching out to their community with announcements in exceptional ways.
- An exchange that had listed TFT before agreed to also assist us with marketing.
- We are exploring a trading contest that increases liquidity of TFT-
### 2.5 PR
- We are supported by experienced experts with networks with journalists.
 This lead to three promising angles with crypto websites that would possibly publish an article about ThreeFold or its use-cases in the next weeks.

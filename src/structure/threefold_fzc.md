# ThreeFold FZC (Dubai)

The original team of ThreeFold was operating from Dubai and Belgium.
The first real ThreeFold company created was in Dubai called ThreeFold FZC in 2016.

## Some memories from 2015+



At one point in time we had an office on the 74e floor of a building close to the airport, it was a very cool spot but we also realized the importance of being located closer to the ground. The view was very cool though. We only stayed there for a little longer than 1 year.

Our main office was and still is in Al Jadaf which is interesting enough a boat shipyard.
This is where a lot of the ideas and work has been done to make ThreeFold possible.



The tower is where our office was, the place behind is called Al Jadaf. Al Jadaf is a cool place, we decided to do something different compared to anyone else, no office in a fancy office building. In stead we have our office next to the water in a very old shipyard, very cool and different, ah yeh it was also much more cost effective (-:




Still today there are more than 100 servers located there in our testlab and the threefold foundation is run from there.

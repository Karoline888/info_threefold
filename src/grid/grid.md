# ThreeFold Grid (TF Grid)

The ThreeFold Grid is built by independent people that together create a pool of connected compute and storage capacity. This is a (token) economy where compute and storage hardware mints a stable currency (the TFT) which is used to rent capacity on the grid to run current and future IT workloads. The currency should be a stable currency and ThreeFold hopes it will be a currency that is used in local economies for many other value transactions as well.

This WIKI presents the basic information required to participate in the ThreeFold Grid. There are a number of different ways to use this technology:

- **As a farmer minting ThreeFold Tokens**:

Farmers purchase and operate compute and storage hardware that they list on the ThreeFold Grid by downloading and installing ThreeFold software. A farmer mints ThreeFold Tokens. Farmers come in many different size and shapes. Farmers can be individuals that have a spare computer or some spare cash. Farmers can also be companies that actively go out and find people to invest in their business of building farming sites and mint Threefold tokens. 

An example of a Farmer company is [Green Edge](https://www.green-edge.net/)

- **As a developer using the TF grid to create and run IT workloads by using Farmer capacity**:

These are people that build services and applications on the TF Grid.

- **As a customer using applications and services developed by developers on top of Farmer capacity**:  

customers use applications on the TF Grid and consume TF Grid resources for which they pay in TF tokens.

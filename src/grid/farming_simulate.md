# Farming Simulator 

## In Wiki Simulator

See [simulator](simulator_configure.md)

## Do it yourself Simulator

To simulate your farming cases you will need access to the 3SDK (a cloud based version is coming soon!) All documentation around this topic can be found on the TFGrid Manual in the simulate section, see below.

## Check our TFGrid Manual

Visit the [3SDK Wiki: TFGrid Manual](https://sdk.threefold.io/)

Besides simulating your farming cases, the 3SDK Wiki is here to help you with:

- Help you understand the ThreeFold Grid architecture into detail
- Installing the 3SDK
- Show you around on the admin panel of the 3SDK
- Deploying the ThreeFold Grid
- Farm Management & Setup

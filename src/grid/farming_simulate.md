# Farming Simulator 

To simulate your farming cases you will need access to the 3SDK (a cloud based version is coming soon!) All documentation around this topic can be found on the 3SDK wiki in the simulate section.

Visit the [3SDK Wiki: Simulate](https://sdk.threefold.io/#/simulator)

Besides simulating your farming cases, the 3SDK Wiki is here to help you with:
- Help you understand the ThreeFold Grid architecture into detail
- Installing the 3SDK
- Show you around on the admin panel of the 3SDK
- Deploying the ThreeFold Grid
- Farm Management & Setup
 
 And more

Visit [sdk.threefold.io](https://sdk.threefold.io) to find out more!

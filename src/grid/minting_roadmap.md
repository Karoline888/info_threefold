## Minting 

 > NO TFT HAVE EVER BEEN CREATED (MINTED) WITHOUT CORRESPONDING FARMING & AVAILABLE CAPACITY

### v1.0 (april 2018)

- measurements done by secure measurement software part of Zero-OS
- reports registered in the TF Grid Directory v1.0
- minting software uses those reports to once a month do the minting & distribution of TFT for farming
- a technical board of 3 people always verified the minting results before execution to make sure that there were no bugs in the minting software
- the genesis pool was inserted at the launch date (april 2018) with all corresponding hardware availability reports
 
 ### v2.0 (may 2020)
 
- measurements done by secure measurement software part of Zero-OS
- reports registered in the TF Grid Directory v2.0 
- minting software uses those reports to once a month do the minting & distribution of TFT for farming
- all capacity is non certified
- minting happens using TFTA
- a technical board of 3 people always verified the minting results before execution to make sure that there were no bugs in the minting software
 
 ### v2.1 (end Aug 2020)
 
- measurements done by smart contract for IT workload (unique feature for TFGrid)
- multiple versions of the smart contract of IT workloads are used (to get to consensus of the measurement)
- workload definition (smart contract for IT) signed by majority of 9 ThreeFold tech guardians
- reports registered in the TF Grid Directory v2.0 and signed the measurement code which was signed by guardians
- minting software uses those reports to once a month do the minting & distribution of TFTA for farming
- capacity can be certified and not certified
- majority of 9 ThreeFold tech guardians verify the minting results before execution to make sure that there were no bugs in the minting software and the correct procedure was followed
- when certified capacity the minting software compares with certification report (amount of resource units)

We believe this is a very secure way how to measure capacity and use unique capabilities of our grid which is the smart contract for IT. 

### v2.x or v3.x 

- hardware support for measurement / verification of capacity of farming nodes
- details to be defined

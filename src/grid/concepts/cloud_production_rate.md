# Cloud Production Rate  (CPR)


The Cloud Production Rate (CPR) shows how ‘productive’ a compute or server hardware platform is. So the higher the more capacity in form of compute and storage is added. 
It makes it simple for a non tech farmer to selct the best farming hardware for the budget available. Similar to the hashrate of for example a Bitcoin miner.

To calculate the CPR are very simple and straightforward formula is used:

### **CPR = 1.5 * the amount of Compute Units (CU) of the hardware + the amount of Storage Units (SU) of the hardware**


How CU and SU are composed and calculayted can be found [here](cloud_units_4.md)

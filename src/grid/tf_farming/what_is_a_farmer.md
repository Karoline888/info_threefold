# The Three Fold Farmer

![](img/farmer.png)

The ThreeFold Grid's Capacity Layer is formed by ThreeFold farmers - individuals or businesses who connect server or storage hardware called 3 Nodes to the ThreeFold Grid. These 3Nodes generate compute and storage capacity and mint ThreeFold Token for the farmer as a reward. Once the farmer's capacity on the ThreeFold Grid gets reserved by a capacity user he gets ThreeFold Token. This is called capacity cultivation income.

### Types of ThreeFold Farmers

There are two types of ThreeFold Farmers

- Certified Farmer: Buys certified hardware and signs a contract with ThreeFold Tech for support. 



- Do It Yourself (DIY) Farmer: Uses any hardware and in case of support uses online material only.

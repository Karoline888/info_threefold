# Minting V2.0 (May 2020 - Aug 2020)

From May 2020 onwards TFT will be minted using the new tokenomics.

## Maximum amount of TFT

There will be a maximum amount of 4 billion TFT minted.

## Cloud production Rate (CPR)

The Cloud Production Rate (CPR) indicates how ‘productive’ a compute or server hardware platform is. The higher the CPR, the more capacity in form of compute and storage is added. This makes it simple for a non-tech farmer to select the best farming hardware for the budget available. It is similar to the hashrate a Bitcoin miner of for example.

To calculate the CPR are very simple and straightforward formula is used:

CPR = 1.5 * the amount of Compute Units (CU) of the hardware + the amount of Storage Units (SU) of the hardware

## CPR Price:

The CPR Price is USD 40 as of Q1 2020

## Cloud Units

## TFT Price

Until further notice the following USD TFT price is used for minting: USD 0.15 plus 2% monthly starting May 2020

## Difficulty Level

The amount of TFT that Farmers receive for farming depends on the amount of TFT that are already in circulation. The more TFT already exist, the lower the rewards. This follows the principle of diminishing returns. We call this farming limitation to rewards Difficulty Level.

When the amount of existing TFT nears 4 billion, the amount of TFT received by farmers will be less. Once the maximum of 4 billion TFT has been reached, there won´t be any rewards for farming anymore.

## Calculation of TFT minted per Node per Period

> Amount of TFT = Amount of CRP * CPR Price USD / TFT Price USD / Difficulty Level

# The ThreeFold Grid: A High Level Introduction
The ThreeFold Grid was built from a complete review of the current Internet architecture. It simplifies the architecture though it's autonomous (self-healing) technology, the first of it's kind, and provides a total new approach to a global Internet. It is the largest peer-to-peer grid of Internet (compute, storage and network) capacity in the world. platform on which experiences (or service) can be built on.

Many projects live on top of the ThreeFold Grid - such as the ThreeFold Peer2Peer cloud and 3Bot.

## Hardware
Just like the traditional approach the ThreeFold Grid at it's base also needs Hardware to function. Servers of all shapes and sizes can be added to the ThreeFold Grid, by anyone, anywhere in the world. As long as there is a connectivity (an existing network) and stable power supply a Node can run.

People that add this hardware to the grid are called farmers.

## Software
Hardware alone will not cut it if you want to change the world. ThreeFold has multiple Open Source technologies to make all these nodes "talk" to each other. One of these software components is our own operating system called Zero OS. Nodes that run this Operations System are called 3Nodes and these are at the core of the ThreeFold Grid.

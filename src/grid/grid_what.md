# The ThreeFold Grid
The ThreeFold Grid is the platform on which services - we also call them experiences - can be built on. Examples for what types of experiences can be built on top of the ThreeFold Grid are the ThreeFold Peer2Peer cloud and the 3Bot digital twin.

The Capacity and Autonomous layer form the ThreeFold Grid.

## The Capacity Layer

Without storage and compute capacity, there would be no Internet. Think of the capacity layer as being the foundation of the Internet. Hardware and software components distributed around the world form the ThreeFold Grid - peer-to-peer network of compute and storage capacity. 

Any application which can run on Linux, can run on the ThreeFold Grid but with more speed, cost-efficiency, privacy & security, sustainability, and more. Any individual or organization can utilize the ThreeFold Grid's capacity for any current or future IT workload - such as Blockchain, IoT, 5G, AI and VR/AR, and benefit from improved performance.

The ThreeFold Grid represents the most advanced and only true peer-to-peer network of capacity in the world.

ThreeFold's Zero OS operating system is used to run on server or storage hardware which we call then 3Nodes. 



## The Autonomous Layer

Imagine the autonomous layer as being the bridge between users and the capacity layer. The system is self-driving and self-healing, therefore removing the human requirement for deploying and operating IT infrastructure and services, and vastly minimizing the possibility of hacking. 

The idea behind the autonomous layer is to make every individual digitally independent and enable a digital world inspired by nature. Just like no one would be able to access your face-to-face conversations or be aware of what you do in your everyday life as you only would know it, the autonomous later undertakes all the processes in the background for you to remain at the center of your digital life.

ThreeFold's 3Bot SDK (Software Development Kit) technology powers the 3Bot Server. The 3Bot Server is th emain component of the Autonomous Layer.

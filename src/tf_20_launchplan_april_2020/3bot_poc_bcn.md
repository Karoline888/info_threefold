2nd half may  the 3bot will launch. This team is not threefold, we are a decentralized movement, this is a new team (we call them circles) who is working on the decentralized launch of the 3bot.

Note the first video made does not get the right reactions yet, was seen as too harsh, we will have to revise, we removed from this doc. We will not go with the masks video, these are only suggestions by the team. All feedback more than welcome.

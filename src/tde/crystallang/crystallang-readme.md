## Project: Crystal Language

![](./img/cystal_logo_stacked_version.svg)

What started as an experiment from Manas labs in June 2011 has grown far more than expected: it has been dubbed the most promising programming language of 2018 by BlockVueâ€™s CTO, and forecasted with a bright future by TechBeacon, among others. The Crystal community has contributors from all over the world, having built over 3500 public libraries, and gathering more than 13000 stargazers. Several companies have built part of their tech stack using Crystal, achieving large performance improvements, while retaining maintainability.

Crystal is a programming language with the following goals:
- Have a syntax similar to Ruby (but compatibility with it is not a goal).
- Be statically type-checked, but without having to specify the type of variables or method arguments.
- Be able to call C code by writing bindings to it in Crystal.
- Have compile-time evaluation and generation of code, to avoid boilerplate code
- Compile to efficient native code.

Crystal language, born & raised at [Manas](https://manas.tech/).  The ThreeFold Foundation and Manas have a similar attitude towards how to make IT better

### Goal
The goal is to adopt the Crystal language as the default language in the ThreeFold grid.  3Bot's are in need of a more effective language to perform efficiently and Crystal language is the answer. 

### Funding
See Roadmap.


### Team
It is an open source, community driven project which has sponsors supporting the development of the language.  The Threefold foundation is a proud member of that [group](https://crystal-lang.org/sponsors/)


### Roadmap

Roadmap and investment plan for the 3Bot connect app.

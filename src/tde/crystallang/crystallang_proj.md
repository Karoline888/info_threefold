## Project: Crystal Language

A language for humans and computers.

What started as an experiment from Manas labs in June 2011 has grown far more than expected: Crystal was dubbed the most promising programming language of 2018 by BlockVueâ€™s CTO, and forecasted with a bright future by TechBeacon, among others. The Crystal community has contributors from all over the world, having built over 3,500 public libraries, and gathering more than 13,000 stargazers. Several companies have built part of their tech stack using Crystal, achieving large performance improvements, while retaining maintainability.

Crystal is a programming language with the following goals:

- Have a syntax similar to Ruby (but compatibility with it is not a goal)
- Be statically type-checked, but without having to specify the type of variables or method arguments
- Be able to call C code by writing bindings to it in Crystal
- Have compile-time evaluation and generation of code, to avoid boilerplate code
- Compile to efficient native code

Crystal language, born & raised at [Manas](https://manas.tech/).  The ThreeFold Foundation and Manas have a similar attitude towards how to make IT better.

### Purpose

The goal is to adopt the Crystal language as the default language for the development of our 2nd generation 3bot core server.

This is a strategic choice and will allow us to have even less memory and CPU footprint when running the 3bots.

### Funding

- Required funding to finish roadmap as described below: 5,000,000 TFT

### Team

ThreeFold works with the [Manas](https://manas.tech/) team.

It is an open source, community-driven project which has sponsors supporting the development of the language. The Threefold Foundation is a proud member of that [group](https://crystal-lang.org/sponsors/).

### Roadmap

The roadmap is still changing but see suggestions below. We are in conversations with the Crystal community and our 3bot development team to fine tune the roadmap.

| Name         | Date   | Description | Remark |
|:-------------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| tbd |  2020/07 | Extended core library for features as required in 3bot. |  |
| tbd |  2020/07 | Language server to have more developer productivity. |  |
| tbd |  2020/09 | Incremental compiler, means much faster. |  |
| tbd |  tbd | Browser based code editor & executor to allow better integration for education purposes. |  |
| tbd |  tbd | Compile to web assembly. |  |

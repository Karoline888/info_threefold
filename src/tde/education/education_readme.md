# Project: PlanED (By TAG)

![alt](https://www.consciousinternet.org/threefold/info/projects/planed/planed.jpeg)

 Every child deserves an education. We at [TAG](https://takeactionglobal.org) have built a community of thousands of teachers globally which allows us to connect to children and teachers in refugee camps. Our platform allows us to train teachers in these camps (67% of which haven't completed secondary education) and create interactions between refugee students and other students globally, changing their mindset and fighting polarization.

## Impact

We want to raise the bar of education by having experts to teach the students and by initiating teacher trainings with help of technology. For years we have been working to bring positive and needed change to the education system and this is another step forward. A peer-to-peer education system opens up the possibilities for learning and positive solutions for our world. Additionally we will be able to set up global projects to tackle climate change and other issues allowing students to connect, brainstorm, create, share, solve problems and take action. We will measure impact in multiple ways â€“ number of teachers and students brought on to the platform, number / impact of solutions brought for global projects, and more. We will work with universities of Harvard, Brussels and Nairobi to collect qualitative and quantitative data measuring impact.

## Powered by ThreeFold

Our peer-to-peer platform will be run on the ThreeFold Grid and will utilize elements of 3Bot technology. 3Bot video conferencing solution will be used to allow teachers to teach refugees. We have already been doing this for five years: projectkakuma.com and with the help of ThreeFold, we will be able to allow people globally to connect and learn from peers, including refugees and people living in harsh conditions.

## Purpose
Most social media platform are owned and operated by single companies. This allows them to trakc and trace the users for their behavior and usage and collect data about what their platform is used for.  There have been several news reports and movies created on the topic that this can lead to inflencing people behavior.

ThreeFold believes in social media but done in a different way.  While centralised pltform linked facebook, instagram and linkedin store data in a centralised platform where data can be mined and analysed why not build a platform that stores data per individual user and allows to the user to decide who to share her's or his data with. In the end the same results, a social platform where people interact and exchange experierences nut remain ultimately in control over what hapenes to their data.

An example software implementation is being use for freeflownation where ThreeFold has identified a potential candidate of open source software to do this and implemented it runnnig on a digital avatar, however the information is still stored in that single (central) digital avatar for everyone.  This needs to be taken to the next level where information is stored decentralised in personal storage spaces managed buy the digital avatar.

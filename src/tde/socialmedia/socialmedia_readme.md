# Project: Social Media

![](./img/freeflowpages.png)

Most social media platform are owned and operated by single companies. This allows them to track and trace the users for their behavior and usage and collect data about what their platform is used for.  There have been several news reports and movies created on the topic that this can lead to influencing people behavior.

ThreeFold believes in social media but done in a different way.  While centralized platform like facebook, instagram and linkedin store data in a centralized platform where data can be mined and analyzed why not build a platform that stores data per individual user and allows to the user to decide who to share her's or his data with. In the end the same results, a social platform where people interact and exchange experiences nut remain ultimately in control over what happens to their data.

An example [software implementation is being used](https://freeflowpages.com/dashboard) for FreeFlowNation where ThreeFold based on open source software running in our grid, while independent and untraceable its not fully peer 2 peer yet and we believe the user experience can be improved.

### Purpose

- To create a true private and independent social media platform by people for people.
- We will not just copy Facebook, a design has been made which is more intuitive and new way how to interact with our social network.
- This application will be a combination of multiple ideas: Linkedin, Facebook, Slack, ... and would be very exciting for all of us.

### Team

- The funding raised for this project will be used to fund opensource developers to create the required software for this purpose.
- There are multiple teams identified how this might happen, the Foundation will oversee the further creation of this project.

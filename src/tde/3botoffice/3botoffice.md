## Project: 3Bot Office

![](3botdemo_slides.png)

### Purpose

Deliver an online office environment which is 100% private to you.
100% integrated with your 3bot.

Millions of people are looking for a neutral office solution which

- is neutral and allows you to own all your data
- is faster
- is easy to use
- more cost effective
- works everywhere
- has advanced features like 
    - real time collaboration

We integrate with [onlyoffice](https://www.onlyoffice.com/) for this, which is in our opinion the best made office solution.
Onlyoffice is opensource (which we use today) but we also want to make a license deal with them to cater for support and allow even enterprises to use this on a larger scale.

### Status today

- We have a full blown first version active and ready to be launched.
- We are now fundraising to make the next generations.

### Is an experience running on top of the 3bot core.

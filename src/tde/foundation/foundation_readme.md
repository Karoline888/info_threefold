## Project: ThreeFold Foundation

ThreeFold's main focus is the TF Grid - an infrastructure empowering a new and democratized digital economy based on our values of equality of access, data sovereignty and environmental sustainability. We aim to enable +1 billion people with access to the fundamental internet infrastructure and their full digital lives (education, banking and internet access) for less then 1$ per person per month by 2030.

### Impact

ThreeFold's Grid will help to give data sovereignty back to people and countries, as well as enable accessibility to digital innovation to billions of people in countries lacking in internet infrastructure and finally it will help dramatically reduce the footprint of our current internet by using smaller and more efficient mini data nodes. The success of our efforts can be measured by the growth of the ThreeFold Grid in terms of number of hardware nodes, the amount of capacity utilized on the ThreeFold Grid and the number of projects for example from the blockchain space using and promoting the ThreeFold Grid. We are currently talking with more than 25 blockchain projects out of top 200 to invite them to explore possible use cases on the ThreeFold Grid. Five of them already agreed/signed for a co-promotion marketing campaign with us and will invite their community to try out the ThreeFold Grid.

### Part of ThreeFold

The ThreeFold Grid is one of the most essential layers in the ThreeFold Project as it provides a global mesh network to run and store our internet applications and services.



### Join saving our planet!

If not us, who? If not now, when?

Our project is about promoting the adoption and expansion of ThreeFold Grid in order to empower a new and democratized digital economy based on our values of equality, autonomy and sustainability.ThreeFold's Grid will help to give data sovereignty back to people and countries, as well as enable accessibility to internet access to billions of people in countries lacking in internet infrastructure, and finally it will help dramatically reduce the footprint of our current internet by using smaller and more efficient mini data nodes, less fiber network, a unique storage algorithm, and more. The ThreeFold Grid is one of the most essential elements of building a new internet as it provides a global network to run and store our internet applications and services.Today we are live with more than 40,000,000 GB of capacity and 15,000 CPU cores across 20+ countries. We have launched the ThreeFold Grid SDK meaning that anyone can begin to utilize the ThreeFold Grid. We are currently talking with more than 25 blockchain projects out of top 200 to invite them to explore possible use cases on the ThreeFold Grid. And we have a number of other partners ready to host or build on top of the ThreeFold Grid. The success of our efforts can be measured by the growth of the ThreeFold Grid in terms of number of hardware nodes, the amount of capacity utilized on the ThreeFold Grid and the number of projects using and promoting the ThreeFold Grid.

## Foundation Projects

### Introduction
The ThreeFold Foundation has launched a new ThreeFold Token (TFT) on a new payment network called Stellar. Stellar is a very reliable platform used by more and more projects.

We are organizing a Token Distribution Event on Stellar to benefit projects which have as a purpose to provide value to the ThreeFold movement and do good for our planet. Up to 70 million TFT are offered for sale on Stellar and later on at least 2 public exchanges.

We migrate our existing TFT (ThreeFold Tokens on our own blockchain called Rivine) to Stellar. These TFT will be called TFTA on Stellar. This TFTA has the same rights as your current TFT on Rivine:

- You can transfer it to anyone
- You can use it to buy or sell capacity on the TF Grid

By moving the TFTA to Stellar, we get a lot of  additional benefits:

- Your TFTA is tradeable on Stellar decentralized exchange
- Your TFTA will automatically convert to the new TFT at end of this year, and you can sell your TFTA as TFT by means of the ThreeFold market making bot starting July

So we at ThreeFold are very excited about this move!

### Project Funding

As stated in the introduction, we will offer project branded TFTs to fund a portfolio of projects working with the ThreeFold foundation and using TF Grid resources. By buying tokens, you directly support these projects and therefore the growth of the ThreeFold Grid and its experiences. These projects are:

### How Does It Work

For each project TFT tokens will be branded to represent the project.  The project tokens are exchangable to TFT tokens and have the same value.  A the TDE (Token Distribution Event) investors and sponsors can select which project they like most and purchase the project branded tokens.

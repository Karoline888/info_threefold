## Token Distribution Event For TF Grid Use Cases

_Note: If you're interested in participating in the Token Distribution Event, please visit the Token section of this wiki, and in particular "How to Buy."_

### Introduction
The ThreeFold Foundation has launched a new ThreeFold Token (TFT) on a new payment network called Stellar. Stellar is a very reliable platform used by more and more projects.

We are organizing a Token Distribution Event on Stellar to benefit projects (listed below) which have as purposes to provide value to the ThreeFold movement and to do good for our planet. Up to 70 million TFT are offered for sale on Stellar and later on at least 2 public exchanges.

We are migrating our existing ThreeFold Tokens (TFT on our own blockchain called Rivine) to Stellar. These TFTs will be called TFTA on Stellar. The TFTA has the same rights as your current TFT on Rivine:

- You can transfer it to anyone
- You can use it to buy or sell capacity on the TF Grid

By moving the TFTA to Stellar, you get a lot of  additional benefits:

- Your TFTA is tradeable on Stellar decentralized exchange
- Your TFTA will automatically convert to the new TFT at end of this year, and you'll be able to sell your TFTA as TFT by means of the ThreeFold market making bot starting in July

So, we at ThreeFold are very excited about this move!

### Project Funding

As touched on in the introduction, we will offer "branded" TFTs to fund a portfolio of projects working with the ThreeFold Foundation and using TF Grid resources. By buying tokens, you directly support these projects and therefore the growth of the ThreeFold Grid and its experiences. These projects are:

### How Does It Work

For each project, TFTs will be branded to represent the project. The project tokens are exchangable to TFTs and have the same value. During the TDE (Token Distribution Event) investors and sponsors can select which project they like the most and purchase the project branded tokens (listed below).

Any normal TFTs purchased during the TDE will be distributed according to the pie chart above.

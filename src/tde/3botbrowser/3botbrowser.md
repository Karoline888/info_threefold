### Purpose

3Bot browser is a browser that runs close to you digital twin. It presents you with the ability to have a browser on the TF Grid running anywhere you want and to securely stream the content back to you local browser.  

It provides you with privacy and independence, so people and companies cannot track your whereabouts based on the location of your browser.

A lot of hacking happens in your browser, through this approach this is no longer an issue.

### Goal

Create an independent and private browsing experience on the internet.

### Funding

- Required funding to finish roadmap as described below: 3,000,000 TFT
- ThreeFold and Jimber work together in close collaboration, the 3bot browser is IP from Jimber but ThreeFold can use this for the grid usecases with no limits, thats also why we further want to sponsor this project.

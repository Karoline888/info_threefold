![](./img/jimber_browser.png)

### Purpose

3Bot browser is a browser that runs close to your digital twin - 3Bot. It presents you with the ability to have a browser on the ThreeFold Grid running anywhere you want and to securely stream the content back to your local browser.  

A lot of hacking happens in your current browser, but this won't be possible with 3Bot browser. It provides you with real privacy and independence, so people and companies cannot collect your data such as location details an more.

### Status

- We have a full blown first version active and ready to be launched.
- We are now fundraising to make the next generations.

### 3Bot Browser experience will be on 3bot

See [3bot main page](3botproj).

### Team

[The Jimber Team](https://www.jimber.org/contact.html)

### Funding

- Required funding to finish road map as described below: 3,000,000 TFT
- ThreeFold and Jimber work together in close collaboration, the 3bot browser is IP from Jimber but ThreeFold can use this for the grid use-cases with no limits, thats also why we further want to sponsor this project.

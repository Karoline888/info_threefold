# Project: 3Bot Browser

![](./img/jimber_browser.png)

3Bot browser is a browser that runs close to your digital twin - 3Bot. It presents you with the ability to have a browser on the ThreeFold Grid running anywhere you want and to securely stream the content back to your local browser.  

### Purpose

A lot of hacking happens in your current browser, but this won't be possible with 3Bot browser. Millions of people are looking for a neutral browser solution which is:
- neutral 
- allows you to own all your data
- faster, simple to use
- cost-effective
- able to work everywhere
- has advanced features like real time collaboration

### Status

- We have a full blown first version active and ready to be launched.
- We are now fundraising to make the next generations.

### 3Bot Browser experience will be on 3bot

See [3bot main page](3botproj).

### Team

[The Jimber Team](https://www.jimber.org/contact.html)

### Funding

- Required funding to finish road map as described below: 3,000,000 TFT
- ThreeFold and Jimber work together in close collaboration, the 3bot browser is IP from Jimber but ThreeFold can use this for the grid use-cases with no limits, thats also why we further want to sponsor this project.

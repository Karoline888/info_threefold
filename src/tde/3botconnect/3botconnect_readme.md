## Project: 3Bot Connect

### Purpose
Provide private, independent, and peer-to-peer video conferencing. Other conference solutions use centralized infrastructure and software to connect people. This central infrastructure needs enormous connectivity and hardware to connect large numbers of people. The 3bot Connect solution creates peer-to-peer connections.

### Goal
Create an independent and private peer-to-peer video conferencing solution. Using peer-to-peer technology avoids creating large bottlenecks in the center of the solution which can lead to loss of quality of video and audio signal. On the privacy front it makes sure that nobody can steal information about what is being communicated. A private video conferencing solution.

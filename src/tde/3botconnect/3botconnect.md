## Project: 3Bot Connect

![](./img/3bot_connect.png)

### Purpose

Provide private, independent, and peer-to-peer video conferencing. Other conference solutions use centralized infrastructure and software to connect people. This central infrastructure needs enormous connectivity and hardware to connect large numbers of people. The 3bot Connect solution creates peer-to-peer connections.

We believe that a video conferencing solution like 3Bot Connect has a lot of potential on top of the ThreeFold Grid. 

Millions of people are looking for a neutral Video Conferencing solution which

- is neutral
- is faster
- is easy to use
- more cost effective
- works everywhere

### Status today

- We have a full blown first version active and ready to be launched.
- We are now fundraising to make the next generations.
- The 3bot connect is a huge project and has many technical challenges but we already got very far. [Jimber Team](https://www.jimber.org/securityBroker.html) is the driving force behind this project.

### Improvements Compared To market

Create an independent and private peer-to-peer video conferencing solution. Using peer-to-peer technology avoids creating large bottlenecks in the center of the solution which can lead to loss of quality of video and audio signal. On the privacy front it makes sure that nobody can steal information about what is being communicated. A private video conferencing solution.

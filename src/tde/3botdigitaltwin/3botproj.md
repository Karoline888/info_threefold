### Purpose

While 3bot may seem like a technological solution, its roots and goals are strongly humanitarian. Every person who signs up for 3bot makes a significant impact. The P2P infrastructure is up to 10x more efficient and sustainable and ensures data privacy and security is preserved. The internet cost is less than half a dollar a month per user, greatly increasing access to under-served communities. Additionally, the 3bot ecosystem is creating a number of P2P experiences (new approach to applications) and solutions such as videoconferencing, file storage and social networking that will impact both the effectiveness and security of online interactions.

3bot's vision is to shape a conscious digital world where all individuals, across regions, have equal chances to learn, partake, and succeed, in the best environment possible. A digital world where freedom and liberalism are at the center, and where we live sustainably and think circularly. The priority is to ensure the best environment possible for humanity to interact and all living species of this plant. The circular economies will be created to use resources consciously and to have true value at the center. Future economies will be digital and promote sustainability.


### Status

A first website has been created at [https://3bot.org/](https://3bot.org/) to showcase the idea, an updated version is being created as we speak, the new website will launch 20 May.

The objective is to:
- Deliver an app which replaces our full digital life as we know it today.
- We already have lots of applications (experiences) already created to be launched with 3Bot, but a lot more needs to happen.
- Already today we have office, file manager, mail, chat, contacts, and more ready in a working proof of concept. *Feel free to ask for a demo.*

### 3Bot lives on the ThreeFold Grid

3bot is built by Threefold Tech and lives on the Threefold Grid, serving as the gateway of the new digital world, the new internet and peer-to-peer experiences. By using 3bot SDK, 3bot users could create their own experiences, functionalities and features within the Threefold Gridâ€™s peer-to-peer ecosystem. 3Bot represents a bridge between the ThreeFold Grid and the full power of autonomous technology to deploy decentralized applications.

### Team

There are multiple teams identified to work on the 3bot development, the main one being the [Jimber Team](https://www.jimber.org/contact.html).

# Money of Good

![](./img/money_of_good.jpg)

Money of Good is a socioeconomic platform that uses disruptive proof-of-meditation technology (neurofeedback+blockchain) to offer people the chance to earn money as a reward for practicing meditation, improving their health, and raising consciousness, while fostering a new fair and sustainable economic model: the conscious economy of the common good.

### Purpose

The main purposes are the raise of global consciousness and the birth of a new regenerative and conscious economic model. The sub purposes are the improvement of global health, the empowerment of individuals economically by minimizing inequality, and the leverage of sustainable local businesses.

### Status Today

Today, Money of Good has a functional platform / application that reads brain waves and that through neurofeedback, gives recommendations on how to improve medication practice via a game-like app. It uses this data to generate a unique cryptographic record on the blockchain. This record then validates at the end of each session how much be paid in the Good currency.

## Project: 3Bot Marketing

![](https://www.consciousinternet.org/threefold/info/projects/3bot/3bot.jpg)

3bot's vision is to shape a conscious digital world together. A fair world where all individuals, across regions, have equal chances to learn, partake, and succeed. A world where freedom and liberalism are at the center. A world where we live sustainably and where we think circularly.

### Purpose

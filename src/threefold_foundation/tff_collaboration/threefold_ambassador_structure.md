## changes to our TF ambassador working

- threefold circles will be created as mechanism to provide added valued to the threefold community
    - it would be amazing if you want to be part of one or more of these circles as admin, contributor, story owner, circle owner or member
    - all circles are on https://circles.threefold.me/
    - all circles are 100% transparent to the world (purpose, activities, achievements, ...)
    - each circle will have their own telegram channel (later 3bot) and limited to members of the circle
    - each circle will have a fixed meeting room on https://freeflowconnect.threefold.me/ (our own zoom alternative)
    - each circle can ask funding to ThreeFold foundation (in TFT) to organize their operations.
- the ambassador cafe 
    - will be a circle organized online meeting place (by the community itself, not threefold)
    - will organize online events where everyone is free to join depending the topic
    - can optionally use FreeFlow Pages to community
    - can restart a telegram channel if that would be the wish of its members but will not be used by ThreeFold for communication
- the ambassador cafe telegram will close down
- a new ambassador group telegram will be created but will be moderated
    - anyone who is not in line with the chat guidelines will be put on readonly or blocked.
    - please be reminded the forum is a very good place to ask questions

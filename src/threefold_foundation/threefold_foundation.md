# ThreeFold Foundation


In this part of the wiki we would like to offer 100% transparency into the structure of the ThreeFold Foundation, and how it all came together and will move forward.

A short summary of what is documented throughout this part of the wiki:

In the earlier days of the ThreeFold Foundation there where 2 multiple teams collaboration, but the core teams where located in Dubai and Belgium.

In Dubai we had: [ThreeFold FCZ](threefold_fcz.md)
In Belgium we have: [ThreeFold VZW](threefold_vzw.md) part of the VZW is the [Wisdom Council](wisdom_council.md).

All technology used by the VZW was created by 3 Companies: GreenIT Globe, ThreeFold FCZ & [ThreeFold Tech](tftech.md). The last two still actively participate in creation of tech components used by the ThreeFold Foundation today.. 

To kickstart the ThreeFold Grid back in 2017 ThreeFold FCZ and [Bettertoken](bettertoken.md) committed large amounts of capacity to the grid. Later both became daughter companies of ThreeFold VZW.

## TF Update at Launch Time

### What are we super happy about

* That we did not do an ICO/IEO, it would have put us in a very bad situation today.
* That we managed to stay loyal to our values.

### What worked

* We predicted a period for crypto that the bubble would crash, this kind of happened +90% of crypto projects are not going anywhere, just like in any bubble, after the bubble there will always be strong revival and growth.
* We predicted that blockchain will eventually be seen as not the solution for decentralization, this is happening now, another approach is needed. People more and more understand this and recognize our approach as a good one.
* We always stayed on the course of not taking shortcuts to make sure we are a strong project once the crypto will be re-born with new values to come, this seems to be the time.
* Despite not having enough funding, because we did not do an ICO/IEO, we managed to find enough funds to bring us where we are today. Thanks to super loyal members of our community willing to support us and buying farmed tokens from the foundation.
* We managed to find lots of partners to work with over the next months and to launch together with us, we will do this not all at once but step by step.
* Interest for the 3bot is huge, community growing from that perspective, new community found and people to bring 3bot alive (see further), this made us able to focus on threefold grid & TFT!
* TF Grid 2.0 is a reality by now and launched and working, still some SDK installer issues but working through that.
* Stellar integration worked and is active.
* We keep on funding investors for TFTech,** thank you everyone** involved, this is important otherwise the technology creation stops, this takes a lot of time though.

### What worked, but took longer or was not so easy

* Consensus over tokenomics, there still seems to be no 100% agreement yet that is why we will start a poll today to make sure everyone agrees, it's only since this weekend that we are close enough to even do the poll.
* We underestimated completely how difficult it is to change a token model while being operational, getting it right and making sure everyone understands is difficult.

### What did not work !!!

* We always were very clear (since June 2019), that we can only launch on public exchanges if we have enough funding from crypto investors to be able to feed money to liquidity providers (sometimes called market makers). Without strongly funded market makers, it's +- impossible to launch on an exchange without having the token price to crash after first hype. We did not find investors to do this, we have a funnel of interested investors but they are waiting for stable tokenomics and defined token launch plan, which is only getting established now.
* Liquid was not ready with their integration yet, also they required us to use an external marketmaker which costs +20k USD per month.

### Next steps

Stellar is an amazing platform, it has a built-in exchange.

Stellar has a lot of liquidity on all major exchanges.

This means it's super easy for everyone to buy XLM (Stellar native Currency) and go from XLM to TFT or other way around.

We focus on real traction & organic growth, no big bang hyped launch. We have lots of beautiful partner projects we can launch with. Every week starting now we will announce fantastic things happening, this will allow us to have a steady stream of events and news to go into the market, this will give us the credible image we need and allow us to become a global player based on strong foundations. This will lead to stable TFT liquidity.

We donâ€™t want crypto gamblers to use our token as a basis for their game, once we are on public exchanges without support from a big marketmaker WITH FUNDING, it's impossible to keep our token stable. **That is why the chosen launch process is to control the inflow of TFT and keep the price stable that way, this is in the best interest of every token holder.**

In the meantime market influencers will help us to find the reach we need.

### Going live on public exchanges

We have the ability to go on more exchanges and get approval and were accepted but all of them cost money to support and go for. We have already paid the required fees for two public exchanges.

Our approach is that we will go live on Stellar first and get sales going of our tokens using the power of our own and partner projects (TFGrid, 3bot, virtual reality museum, P2P Education project, time token, ...).

At a later point, we will launch on Liquid, BTC Alpha and possibly other public exchanges after they have integrated our token and onboarded a marketmaker. Currently, we are aiming for the 20th of May for Liquid and BTC Alpha. Both exchanges already committed themselves to add to our marketing & PR efforts by reaching out to their communities in exceptional ways.

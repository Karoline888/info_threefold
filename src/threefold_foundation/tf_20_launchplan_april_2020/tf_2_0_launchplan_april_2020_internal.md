## TFT Market Making / Liquidity providing

It would be ideal if we would be able to work with funded market makers, for that we need more funding.

TF Foundation is talking with quite some TFT potential investors who were waiting for stable tokenomics and agreement in our community, we will now further talk with them over next months and try to raise up to 5m USD or more, this money will be used to fund a market maker/liquidity provider which will allow us to go on public exchanges with more price protection.

# TF Update at Launch Time

### History

* [community update call feb](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18BRu9z7gVl3fDTfiL6fdnvgKsG3qxZw__e4O3ea04ww/edit#slide=id.g6dfe1c64b5_0_106) 2020

* [community update call march](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1a78HK6K_SsWEQnXF3pG1Sx47HSAMzyRf71PwCL23hmc/edit#slide=id.g6dfe1c64b5_0_106) 2020

### What are we super happy about

* That we did not do an ICO/IEO, it would have put us in a very bad situation today.
* That we managed to stay loyal to our values.

### What worked

* We predicted a period for crypto that the bubble would crash, this kind of happened +90% of crypto projects are not going anywhere, just like in any bubble, after the bubble there will always be strong revival and growth.
* We predicted that blockchain will eventually be seen as not the solution for decentralization, this is happening now, another approach is needed. People more and more understand this and recognize our approach as a good one.
* We always stayed on the course of not taking shortcuts to make sure we are a strong project once the crypto will be re-born with new values to come, this seems to be the time.
* Despite not having enough funding, because we did not do an ICO/IEO, we managed to find enough funds to bring us where we are today. Thanks to super loyal members of our community willing to support us and buying farmed tokens from the foundation.
* We managed to find lots of partners to work with over the next months and to launch together with us, we will do this not all at once but step by step.
* Interest for the 3bot is huge, community growing from that perspective, new community found and people to bring 3bot alive (see further), this made us able to focus on threefold grid & TFT!
* TF Grid 2.0 is a reality by now and launched and working, still some SDK installer issues but working through that.
* Stellar integration worked and is active.
* We keep on funding investors for TFTech,** thank you everyone** involved, this is important otherwise the technology creation stops, this takes a lot of time though.

### What worked, but took longer or was not so easy

* Consensus over tokenomics, there still seems to be no 100% agreement yet that is why we will start a poll today to make sure everyone agrees, it's only since this weekend that we are close enough to even do the poll.
* We underestimated completely how difficult it is to change a token model while being operational, getting it right and making sure everyone understands is difficult.

### What did not work !!!

* We always were very clear (since June 2019), that we can only launch on public exchanges if we have enough funding from crypto investors to be able to feed money to liquidity providers (sometimes called market makers). Without strongly funded market makers, it's +- impossible to launch on an exchange without having the token price to crash after first hype. We did not find investors to do this, we have a funnel of interested investors but they are waiting for stable tokenomics and defined token launch plan, which is only getting established now.
* Liquid was not ready with their integration yet, also they required us to use an external marketmaker which costs +20k USD per month.

### Next steps

Stellar is an amazing platform, it has a built-in exchange.

Stellar has a lot of liquidity on all major exchanges.

This means it's super easy for everyone to buy XLM (Stellar native Currency) and go from XLM to TFT or other way around.

We focus on real traction & organic growth, no big bang hyped launch. We have lots of beautiful partner projects we can launch with. Every week starting now we will announce fantastic things happening, this will allow us to have a steady stream of events and news to go into the market, this will give us the credible image we need and allow us to become a global player based on strong foundations. This will lead to stable TFT liquidity.

We donâ€™t want crypto gamblers to use our token as a basis for their game, once we are on public exchanges without support from a big marketmaker WITH FUNDING, it's impossible to keep our token stable. **That is why the chosen launch process is to control the inflow of TFT and keep the price stable that way, this is in the best interest of every token holder.**

In the meantime market influencers will help us to find the reach we need.

### Going live on public exchanges

We have the ability to go on more exchanges and get approval and were accepted but all of them cost money to support and go for. We have already paid the required fees for two public exchanges.

Our approach is that we will go live on Stellar first and get sales going of our tokens using the power of our own and partner projects (TFGrid, 3bot, virtual reality museum, P2P Education project, time token, ...).

At a later point, we will launch on Liquid, BTC Alpha and possibly other public exchanges after they have integrated our token and onboarded a marketmaker. Currently, we are aiming for the 20th of May for Liquid and BTC Alpha. Both exchanges already committed themselves to add to our marketing & PR efforts by reaching out to their communities in exceptional ways.

# How can people buy TFT

Chosen partner 

![image alt text](3bot_poc_bcnteam_image_2.png)

This shows how XLM which is the native currency of the stellar network is doing very well.

It's very easy, buy XLM on any exchange, go to the stellar exchange (there are more interfaces to it), place your order and convert to TFT. It's super simple.

You can also use quite some wallets for it, we have this documented in the 3SDK manual and will also be on our wiki.

![image alt text](3bot_poc_bcnteam_image_3.png)

This is a screenshot of TFT on the interstellar exchange (native to stellar), no abuse all very transparent.

What you see here are people trying to buy super cheap and our initial bootstrap tokens being in the sales order book, very small test amounts for now.

## TFT Market Making / Liquidity providing

It would be ideal if we would be able to work with funded market makers, for that we need more funding.

TF Foundation is talking with quite some TFT potential investors who were waiting for stable tokenomics and agreement in our community, we will now further talk with them over next months and try to raise up to 5m USD or more, this money will be used to fund a market maker/liquidity provider which will allow us to go on public exchanges with more price protection.

# Information for our existing TFT Holders & Farmers


## Tokenonomics update for farmers

[tokenomics update for farmers](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AaQeoyMYg6i1aWlB6M1ukBaRaq_DGvea5yNpkTsNpE8/edit?usp=sharing)[slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AaQeoyMYg6i1aWlB6M1ukBaRaq_DGvea5yNpkTsNpE8/edit?usp=sharing)


## TFT market maker bot

Our aim is to have TFT be a stable digital currency which has a relation to the (future) value of the ThreeFold grid.

If we would just launch all the TFT on public exchanges the price would become very speculative and potentially even crash, this for sure is not in line with our intention.

This means that the only other option we have is to control the inflow of TFT. We do this by establishing a step approach of how the TFT can enter the market on the Stellar network.

PLEASE NOTE: every TFT is the result of farming (people or company's connecting IT capacity to the internet and records are registered of every minting (farming) action on the Rivine TFT blockchain as a result of connected capacity.

Following order is maintained

1. May-June: upto 70m TFT can be sold by Foundation & ThreeFold technology providing parties, this token introduction (all coming from existing farmed Rivine TFT) has only a benefit for the value creation of the grid and the ONLY intention is to promote the further usage & development of the grid. This is only a short period of 2 months.

2. May-June: any existing TFT token holder who really needs to have some liquidity during this period can contact the TF Foundation. The TF Foundation will see what is possible to resell some or all of your TFT. Please note that priority will be given to people who chose to support the foundation since Aug 2019 to make this launch 2.0 possible, this is logical because these token buyers bought the tokens from the TF Foundation in the first place to make it all possible and this has been mentioned on multiple update calls, the foundation needed funding to continue !!!

3. Every person buying tokens on Stellar can sell at any point in time at any price chosen. We hope that people will be reasonable and keep the price stable and consider the future value of the grid (see simulator).

4. July 1, 2020, till Jan 1 2021: every original Rivine TFT token holder can sell on the Stellar blockchain through the TFT bot market maker.

5. Jan 1 2021, all TFT token holders can define price at free will and we hope by then to have achieved enough liquidity to keep the TFT market stable and in line with future value of the TF Grid.

**TFT market maker bot**

While potentially the name is misleading, because this bot does not have funding to keep a market stable, this bot has as goal to allow any Rivine token holder to sell tokens to the Stellar network and provide some price protection.

Technical detail: the original Rivine TFTâ€™s are going under name TFTA on the Stellar blockchain until the end of  2020. Starting 2021 this name difference will go away, do note that a TFTA or TFT is the same. Jan 2021, all TFTA get converted into TFT at same conditions on TFTA chain (same lockup periods), which means TFTA stops to exist, users will have to ask this conversion on TF Wallet.

The TFT bot market maker is a digitized bot. We choose to do this through our own digitized bot because a 3rd party bot service costs 20k USD per month.

**All TFTA holders can sell as much as they want starting June 1, 2020 through the TFT market maker bot as long as the price of the TFT is high enough & there is liquidity on the market.**

**The rules the bot maintains are as follows:**

* Until the end of 2020 TFTA can only be sold if the sell price is higher than the min TFT price.

    * Min TFT price by market maker is USD 0.15 starting april 29, 
going up 2% per month compared to the USD, in the unexpected event that the USD would become unstable then the gold price will be used.

    * Every TFTA holder can place sell orders on the digitized market maker bot, 
only 1 order can be open at the same time per TFTA holder. There is no limit to the size of the order.

* The digitized market maker bot will sell per USD 20k onto the market and sales done gets distributed evenly over the sell orders in the order book. 

    * As long as the price is higher than the minimum price the digitized market maker bot will keep on selling until the order book is empty.

* TFTA holders can set the sales price (min sales price) or they can sell at market. 

**remarks**

* The sales orders are always done versus XLM which is the native Stellar currency

* It's very easy for everyone in the world to buy XLM and as such buy TFT.

* The Stellar network allows you to sell to other currencies like BTC, ETH, ... up to 6 levels deep. 

    * This means if someone wants to buy TFT for BTC, it will still work, 
Stellar payments network will convert to XLM and then to TFT.

# How to buy capacity on TF Grid

Capacity can be bought using TFTA, FreeTFT (TFT you get for free on nodes as provided with farmers who donâ€™t mind not to be paid for that capacity) or by TFT as sold on Stellar (owned by Foundation).

Point to info on wiki (later today)

# Structure of the foundation

The following structure is in process of being setup, this is the result of a long process we are almost done.

**ThreeFold Foundation =  Belgium VZW
**

= not for profit, has no shareholders, 

only 12 members which together govern the legalities of the VZW (see below).

By law a VZW in Belgium cannot benefit any member or person who founded the VZW.

**ThreeFold Foundation** owns two 100% owned daughter companies.

* ThreeFold Europe (still called BetterToken, will get name change)

* ThreeFold FZC = Dubai (used to be called Mazraa)

**ThreeFold Europe
**

* Will act as a cooperative for some farming activities and helping to sell farming hardware.

* Peter is the managing director of that company and will report to the board of the Belgium VZW.

**ThreeFold FZC
**

* Is the operational company for the foundation.

* Adnan is the managing director and will report to the board of the Belgium VZW

* ThreeFold FZC is organizing the launch v2.

**Wisdom Council**

A Wisdom Council of 12 people will have to vote over the usage of funds which get collected over years in the foundation (result of the 10% fee which goes to the foundation). This wisdom council are members of the non for profit organization in Belgium. 

# Our ThreeFold Values are not a marketing stunt.

We are humans and we do make mistakes, but our TFTech and TFFoundation team do everything they can to keep our values aligned at any point in time. First of all we align with the freeflow values: [https://www.freeflownation.org/manifesto.html](https://www.freeflownation.org/manifesto.html). Next to these the following values are very specific and we want to use them on a daily basis in relation to our ThreeFold project:

**Planet First**

* What

    * New Internet

    * Independent/Free Digital Life

* The world needs to become more conscious and this is happening we want to be part of this movement.

**No Shortcuts or Fear-Based Decisions**

* No fake hype or other fake constructs e.g. fake liquidity providing

* It's not because others do it that it makes it right

**Respect for future (the right mix between efficiency & stability = see the curve of life)**

* The project needs to grow, trying to have some price stability for TFT is the safe thing to do even if it means less liquidity, we will have to be patient.

* The project needs to be funded, otherwise, there is no future

* The project will grow because of real traction on capacity & 3bot layer

**Heart-based**

* We are building a â€˜heart-basedâ€™ community, it's not ok to let people hijack a communication or use anonymity to make their point, it's not ok to threaten others...

**Respect for investments done (time & $)**

* +40m USD has already been invested

    * Early forward-looking capacity sales(by means of TFT)

    * Funding through Incubator & Kristof: 10-12m EUR

    * Large investment on hardware for all farmers

    * 6-7m EUR for CLA Round TFTech

* We will do everything we can to make grow the value of this project and as such provider return for everyone involved and we are very confident about that.

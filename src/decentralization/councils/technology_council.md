# Threefold Technology Council

Technology guardians are the members of the threefold technology council, there are 9 of them.

Together they take the required decisions for the ThreeFold Grid Related day2day technology decisions.

## What is it

* Group of people who evaluate to their best abilities the technology as needs to be deployed in the grid

* Some examples of decisions which need to be taken

    * Approve code releases.

    * Sign the deployment of the code, so no code can be deployed for production purposes before majority signs.

    * Change in operational changes in the way how the council works

    * Approve new development projects when funded by the ThreeFold foundation

    * Approve for standards/procedures/… as could be relevant for the TFGrid technology stack or operations

    * ...

* The technology council has been approved by the [grid council](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14wRroPcgRBFhmwP_93CMJUK0dYv2UqEOHpZKjeqYeDE/edit#).

    * Each Technology Guardian was interviewed by the grid council and approved to align with 
"fit for duty requirements"

    * This approval cycle will happen in asap.

## Relation with the grid council

* This technology council is the technical brain for the grid council

## Fit for duty requirements

* You really really believe that what is being developed for ThreeFold grid is super important for the planet in an attempt to help raise awareness (consciousness), but in this case for the digital world (internet). You don’t look at this like some technical gimmick but a real necessity.

* There is no ego involved by being a guardian.

    * We realize our own reason to be a guardian is to be at the service of the threefold community and the planet.

* Work on self-development

    * Realize we know nothing and are nothing but will always work in the best interest of the planet. The more we learn the less we know. 

    * Don’t blame others, change starts with ourselves.

    * We see the benefit of self-improvement work e.g. meditation, self-reflection, sessions with energy healer / spiritual coach, …

* Not addicted to 

    * Sex, Food, Substances, Gambling, Power, Money

    * Our definition of addiction

        * We can make decisions without being influenced because of the desire for one of the above-mentioned topics.

        * We are not depending on one of the above to feel happy

* We really believe the values as described on our freeflow nation.

    * [https://freeflownation.org/manifesto.html](https://freeflownation.org/manifesto.html)

    * We know them, we understand them, we agree with them 
(if not we say what to change now)

* If we have a shortcoming in one of the above we are not afraid to be open about it and express our desire to improve on it.

* Technical

    * We are expert for at least 50% of the code as used in TF Grid.

    * We are not shy to read code.

    * We have deep understanding of how it all works.

* Willing to be a Technology Guardian for at least 2 years starting your submission.

## Our charter

We will do everything we can to protect the technical sanity of the ThreeFold Grid core technologies.

We evaluate based on

* Security

* Scalability

* Decentralization

* Sustainability

## Details

* Remuneration

    * 80 EUR value in TFT per hour for the work we do as grid guardians

* How do we work together

    * A public visible circle on circles.threefold.me

* Expect this to be +- 4-8h of work per month and needs to be done outside your normal work responsibilities.

## Voting

* Default voting rights: 66% majority required

    * add/remove a guardian from the grid council

    * approve minting operation

    * approve software release (upgrade of grid software, check that the right auditors have been used to make sure the software is ok, check the testing cycles)

    * approve monthly budgets for the foundation

* Each guardian can initiate a voting round

* Each guardian has a voting account on stellar.

* A voting wallet is co-owned by each member of the grid council.

* Each vote is a transaction prepared (sending 1 TFT from voting wallet to voting wallet) with the voting ID and voting hash (hash is a unique key guaranteeing the validity of the content of the voting request) as part of the transaction description. This makes sure that everyone with 100% certainty agrees on the voting request and signs the transaction.

* Transactions can only happen if at least 6 of the 9 people sign.

## Onboarding

* Personal page on Alliance for conscious Internet (see Karoline for help)

    * Mention all technical work you do (link to github repo’s, …)

* Prepare voting request for your own onboarding request (become member of council)

    * Example will be given by Kristof

* A video on vimeo (threefold account) which talks <2min about why you want to be part of council and why you believe you are in line with the requirements to be a guardian. Also talk about where you believe you need to improve in line of the requirements. Make sure people can see your good intentions.

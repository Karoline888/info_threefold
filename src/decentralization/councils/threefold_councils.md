![alt](threefold_councils.jpg)


Following the true decentralized nature of ThreeFold we have instated 3 different councils to make decisions in regards to Foundation, Technology, & The Grid.

## [Wisdom Council](wisdom_council.md)
Made up by 12 people the Wisdom Council will be responsible for decision in regards to the funds of the ThreeFold Foundation.
10% of all capacity sales on the ThreeFold Grid flow back to the Foundation to support do-good projects all over the world.

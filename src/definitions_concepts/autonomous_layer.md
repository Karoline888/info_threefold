## Autonomous Layer

You can think about this layer as similar to a bee hive, where worker bees create complex “magic” by performing quite simple yet necessary tasks altogether.

Imagine the autonomous layer as being the bridge between users and the capacity layer. The system is self-driving and self-healing, therefore removing the human requirement for deploying and operating IT infrastructure and services, and vastly minimizing the possibility of hacking. 

The idea behind the autonomous layer is to make every individual digitally independent and enable a digital world inspired by nature. Just like no one would be able to access your face-to-face conversations or be aware of what you do in your everyday life as you only would know it, the autonomous later undertakes all the processes in the background for you to remain at the center of your digital life.

The autonomous layer is home to the [3Bot](3bot.md) - your digital twin.

Some key characteristics include:

- Fair: 3Bot users retain full ownership of their data - they choose with whom to share and when.
- Sustainable: Combined with the ThreeFold Grid, 3Bot enables 90% energy and bandwidth savings.
- Peer-to-Peer: No centralized institution nor governance. Enabling a digital world that is truly equal.
- Resilient: The self-healing operating system ensures that in the unlikely case that a node goes down, your data remains private and available.
- Secure: 2FA login, P2P, KYC integration, a decentralized ledger, and a lean code ensure safety.
- Open Source: Information and knowedge is accessible to all. We invite you to create on top of our tech.
- Compatible: Most softwares and coding or programming languages that work on Linux work on our tech.
- Efficient: Ultra-performant and versatile, with 3Bot enjoy a decentralized and efficient experience.
- For Developers: 90% less developing efforts as compared to conventional centralized applications.

3Bot is currently in Beta version. Follow our announcements regarding the upcoming implementations on the [ThreeFold Forum](https://forum.threefold.io/) or the [ThreeFold News Telegram Channel](https://t.me/threefoldnews).

You can already reserve your 3Bot name through 3Bot Connect, which is already available on [Android]((https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.jimber.threebotlogin&hl=en_US)) and [iOS]((https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3bot-connect/id1459845885)). 3Bot Connect is the gateway to 3Bot and provides private and secure logins to all of its components.

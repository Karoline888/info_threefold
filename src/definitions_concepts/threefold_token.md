## ThreeFold Token (TFT)

ThreeFold Token (TFT) is the token of the new internet. It is a decentralized digital currency used to buy autonomous and decentralized Internet services (compute, storage, applications) on the ThreeFold Grid â€“ generated only when active capacity is added to the ThreeFold Grid.

It has a specific commercial utility, since ThreeFold Tokens were conceived as the designated currency for buying and selling capacity on the ThreeFold Grid.

TFTs have not simply been minted and there was never an initial coin offering of any kind. TFTs are exclusively produced through a process called farming, which means that TFTs are generated only when new Internet capacity is added to the ThreeFold Grid. There is no wasteful mining.

TFT is part of the Stellar Network (https://stellar.org).

## Capacity Layer

Much in the way the trees and plants in a forest communicate and share nutrients through underground channels, the capacity layer includes an expanding grid of intelligent connection.

Without storage and compute capacity, there would be no Internet. Think of the capacity layer as being the foundation of the Internet. Hardware and software components distributed around the world form the ThreeFold Grid - peer-to-peer network of compute and storage capacity. 

Any application which can run on Linux, can run on the ThreeFold Grid but with more speed, cost-efficiency, privacy & security, sustainability, and more. Any individual or organization can utilize the ThreeFold Grid's capacity for any current or future IT workload - such as Blockchain, IoT, 5G, AI and VR/AR, and benefit from improved performance.

The ThreeFold Grid represents the most advanced and only true peer-to-peer network of capacity in the world.

Some key characteristics include:

- Decentralized: Consists of 3Nodes - affordable, secure and highly efficient cloud storage units that can be purchased and hosted by anyone for about 1000 USD.
- Autonomous: Deploys and operates the infrastructure without human interaction.
- Efficient:  Algorithms ensure the data is hosted where it is needed.
- Secure: A storage algorithm inspired by space-technology is used and ensures the integrity of all data, even if some nodes go offline.
- Resilient: The self-healing operating system ensures that in the unlikely case that a node goes down, your data remains safe and available.
- Sustainable: Being decentralized and using the greenest hardware available, the ThreeFold Grid is able to save 90% energy compared to conventional data centers. 
- Tamper-proof: Algorithms prove that workloads on the ThreeFold Grid are executed as intended.
- Fair: People that run 3Nodes are called farmers. They are remunerated and incentivized to constantly expand the ThreeFold Grid by generating ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) for the capacity provided.
- Affordable: Data hosted on the ThreeFold Grid costs 70% less compared to other cloud providers.

### DigiByte
 
DigiByte (DGB) is a decentralized global with a focus on Cyber Security, DigiAssets, Payments & Secure communications technologies. The DigiByte blockchain was developed in 2013 and released in January 2014 with an open-source protocol.

Because of its adjustments in the code, DigiByte is very suitable for facilitating fast and secure transactions. Since 2014, many other blockchains like Ethereum, Zcash & Dogecoin have adopted DigiByte technology.

DigiByte has never been funded through an ICO, presale or token sale, nor is there a private company controlling the DigiByte Blockchain in line with our vision for a decentralized digital future.

Anyone can build on top of DigiByte, because it is a secure, scalable secondary layer on top of the global DigiByte blockchain that allows for the decentralized issuance of assets, tokens, smart contracts, digital identity and much more.

The security of the network, it's incredible speed & low fees makes DigiByte very suitable for performing fast and safe transactions.

It is the world's longest, fastest and one of the most secure UTXO (Unspent transaction output) PoW (Proof of Work) based blockchain in existence.

### Vlinder

Vlinder means butterfly in Dutch. We believe in the butterfly effect of a small behavioral change in a connected world. We envision the Vlinder app as a tool empowering you to make those changes. You will be able to know and mitigate your personal environmental footprint by investing in high-impact products and connecting with sustainability-focused businesses. We will provide you with a helicopter view of your bank cards, crypto wallets, and cash expenses while automatically estimating your carbon footprint. You will be able to contribute to community projects and make a profit from offsetting your CO2 emissions by investing in green products with high return.

# 3Bot

The 3Bot project is one of the major use cases on the ThreeFold Grid.

3Bot is a revolutionary digital twin that is designed to execute all of your digital needs. It enables true digital privacy - only you can access your data, and no one else â€“ not even the structures behind it.

The objective of 3Bot as a technology is to enable a switch from an app-centric system to a more secure, neutral, and decentralised digital world designed with people at the center.

To function properly and remain active on the ThreeFold Grid each 3Bot requires ThreeFold Grid capacity and thus ThreeFold Tokens. 

3Bot's website and wiki is currently under development and should become available to the public in May 2020. 

Stay tuned - this project may change your life for the better!

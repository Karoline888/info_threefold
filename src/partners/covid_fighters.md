### Covid Fighters

Covid Fighters have built a technology consortium to test Covid19 from a mobile unit to test whether or not a test subject is infected and contagious. The actual test takes only a few hours and the mobile unit can be deployed in a matter of days. Various types of people (that need to be tested) can be tested easily and frequently and have their contamination state verified and stored in a way that is easily auditable. The process is end-to-end and involves remote medical specialists to assist and advise. Covid Fighters are putting this consortium together to make the world a safer place for people and economies to maintain their 'normalâ€™.

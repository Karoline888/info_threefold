### Harmony

Harmony is a fast and open blockchain for decentralized applications. Its protocol has achieved secure and random state sharding, being the first sharded Proof of Stake on production. 

Harmony's Mainnet supports thousands of nodes in multiple shards, producing blocks in a few seconds with instant finality. The network's staking mechanism reduces centralization while supporting stake delegation, reward compounding and double-sign slashing. 

Harmony aims to build an open network of nodes operated and governed by a large community. Harmony has designed a novel Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism for network security and economics - Effective Proof-of-Stake (EPoS) which reduces centralization and distributes rewards fairly to thousands of validators.

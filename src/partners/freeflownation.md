**FreeFlow Nation**

FreeFlow Nation is a complementary digital nation which flows freely across physical borders, and which welcomes everyone as a digital citizen. FreeFlow Nation is building a framework for a better way forward for humanity and our planet.  Let's reduce dependencies on – and eliminate barriers created by – flawed and biased centralized systems, and put people back in control of their lives.

FreeFlow Nation aims to empower billions of people with sustainable access to complementary education, internet, and currencies (banking) for less than $1 per month. ThreeFold is part of the FreeFlow Nation.

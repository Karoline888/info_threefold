### Earth Project

Every child deserves an education. We have built a community of thousands of teachers globally which allows us to connect to children and teachers in refugee camps. Our platform allows to train teachers in refugee camps (67% of which haven't completed secondary education) and have interactions between refugee students and students globally changing their mindset and fighting polarization.

EarthProject aims to develop a platform for peer-to-peer education, where teachers become students and students become teachers.

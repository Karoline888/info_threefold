### Zetako

Zetako is creating, storing, and sending more data than ever before, and this trend will certainly continue as more people come online and with trends such as Internet of Things and 5G, as examples. More data means more energy consumption, which is not good for our planet.

For many years, research has been focused on increasing the capacity of 40 year old compressions algorithms (LZW) instead of developing new approaches. Zetako believes that the world’s exponential data creation, processing and storage needs cannot be met with old optimized algorithms. To use Albert Einstein's words: “We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.”

By applying Einstein's words, they developed a brand new mathematical theory based on Statistical Predictive modeling and applied this to a new lossless data compression technology. The result is a technology that provides 30% more compression and Speed and uses 70% less energy in the process. In addition to this, the technology is capable of doing bit-by-bit compression allowing for real time bandwidth reduction - the technology does NOT need a prior knowledge of the dataset to start compression. In layman terms, this means that our technology does not require the data stream to be chopped up into chunks - we apply compression the moment the first bit (1 or 0) comes in.

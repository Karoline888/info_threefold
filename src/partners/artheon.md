### Artheon

The Artheon VR Museum is and always will be a free educational platform offering immersive, next level interaction with objects of cultural heritage.

This allows deeper and more detailed perception and study ensuring access to objects of art and culture for children, youth and all who find it difficult or impossible to take a journey to art exhibitions.

Art is one of the most important tools to inspire faith and cultural growth giving a new perspective of looking at reality. We believe that free global access to fine art and culture is a prerequisite for the development of human kind.

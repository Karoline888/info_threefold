### Beliive

We are the world’s largest collaborative network that uses time as currency to enable collaboration and equal opportunities among people. We believe in promoting equality through the use of time as currency.

Time is equal, no matter who or where you are, one hour has the same value for everyone!

Our network is free for individuals! When you join our community, you receive 5 be. credits (A be. credit equals one hour, and that's our currency for you to exchange experiences - it doesn't cost any money!). You can start requesting new experiences right away. As you start sharing your experiences with other users, you will gain 1 time credit per shared hour.

You can share any experience, skill or experience that can help other users in our community. At beliive, we don’t exchange any kind of product or sell anything. We believe in empowering people to share new experiences at any time!

That way, you collaborate and exchange experiences without using money as a currency. At beliive, time is the common currency of equality. If you represent a company and want to know more about beliive communities and pricing, please contact us here.

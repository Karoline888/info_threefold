### Crystal Home

Our planet needs a different approach to housing. The construction industry is one of the most polluting sectors out there, and we are changing it. We are building circular and fully self-sufficient homes that make housing construction affordable and sustainable without compromising on quality. All of the construction materials are second hand and refurbished for a new life.

Crystal home is building circular & self-sufficient homes reducing the CO2 footprint and the waste flow of the construction industry. And by doing this project we also can provide many people affordable housing in a sustainable way.

# ThreeFold Ecosystem

![](./img/partners_intro.png)

ThreeFold's vision is to empower a global sustainable and conscious peer-to-peer Internet that is available everywhere and owned by everyone â€“ across geographical and cultural borders, empowering people to be autonomous, and providing equal chances to learn, partake and succeed.

This is a collective story. The ecosystem section showcases the current ThreeFold Ecosystem that collaborates towards this vision. In this ecosystem, we develop together human and planet first solutions to set the foundation for a better future.

We are currently growing our ecosystem. Let's connect!

# Muhammed Azmy - @muhammedazmy

I have been a software engineer even before I realize it, or know what to call it. Since i started copying pieces of code to my first MSX computer. I have the passion to build, I have a passion to save the planet, and the future of my kids. I have passion for art. What I am doing at threefold is combination of all my passions, writing beautiful, almost artistic pieces of software, to build a system to give freedom to the people, reduce carbon emissions, and to save the future.
I'm mainly involved in building infrastructure components including ZOS, 0-fs, BCDB, and some top level applications that runs on the grid like MinIO.

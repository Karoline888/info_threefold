# TFTech FACT SHEET

## Fact, we have 10x more capacity online than all other crypto projects together.

* Valuation of all of these crypto projects is Billions

* Our valuation of the token is only 18m USD, lots of growth potential...

## Fact: we have support from a big IT partner (HPE)

* this support is very profound and the right people but it needs more work. We believe this will lead to very good business.

* We have other fantastic partners like Solidaridad, Green Edge Cloud, ...

## Fact: We have a good team with very decent good "valuable" people

* Who do this for the right reason.

* Who mean well and we are committed to making this a success independent of what comes our way.

* Who don’t have the habit of giving up, failing is simply not an option (-:

## Fact: our technology is there

* It's badly documented

    * too much is still in Kristof’s mind and not always even clear for our own engineers.

    * It's impossible for anyone right now out of GitHub to see how it all fits together and how it works, they will see lots of code with inconsistent documentation.

* All the individual components are there and are used in the field e.g. 

* It's all opensource and all licenses are ok, we have been working on this over many years in different companies in our incubator, certain parts & ideas go back a long time.
TFTech is able to take any of this code and do with it whatever TFTech wants, all the code has been moved/forked into TFTech org in Github, all licenses & code are open. The core like ZeroOS, Jumpscale & Rivine we never want to consider making this private, it will always stay opensource. Additional pieces can/will be developed which can be made closed source if that would ever be required e.g. reporting, monitoring, auditing, ...

## Fact: the market is there

* Edge cloud computing is huge, it's one of the biggest growth areas in IT right now.

* Amazon, Google, .. are by design not edge and cannot really go there without re-inventing them completely.

* Once we have more credibility and we have shown our capabilities we will be worth billions, this we are personally convinced off.

## Fact: we are building a solid community

* It's not with hype.

* It's not a big community yet BUT is a very solid community with good people who mean well and really want to help.

* We have so many people who want to help

## Fact: our tech team is very good but very young

* We have incredible people who are super capable and we have developed so much over the last years. We need to professionalize the team, some more senior members, this is one of the reasons why we are doing this fundraising.

## Fact: our biz dev team is good & professional

* We have a very good solid biz dev team which can really bring in the right business for us.

* I believe we can be break even within 6 months and we are going for it.

## Fact: the numbers

* Team

    * Nr of people in Belgium:

    * Nr of people in Egypt:

    * Nr of people in other areas of Europe:

* Monthly burn rate at this point: +- 300k USD per month

* Cash flow budget can be provided if you want.

## Fact: we are different, VERY DIFFERENT.

* Don’t expect an approach to technology like so many other startups, I think we have proven ourselves enough in the past that we can develop groundbreaking tech.

* Our tokens are unlike any other digital currency today, we did not do an ICO, there is nothing to compare too.

* We are different, wanna be different and will keep on being different, this is what I believe the IT ecosystem needs and what customers want.

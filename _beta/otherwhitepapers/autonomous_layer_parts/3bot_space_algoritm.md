### How is this "Space Algorithm" used by the 3Bot

![image alt text](/img/matrix.png)

By nature, a 3Bot is stateless (has no data storage of its own). A 3Bot owns digital currency (ThreeFold Token or TFT) which the 3Bot can use to reserve raw storage and compute resources on the grid.

Each 3Bot has a unique capability to use this CPU and storage capacity from the different TF Nodes in the TF Grid in a safe and reliable way. Data cannot be lost because of the above described dispersed storage algorithm.

A 3Bot can store a petabyte of information as long as enough TFTs are available so the required resource can be reserved on the individual TF Nodes. 3Bot is the only entity which has the required information and keys to make retrieval of the distributed data possible.

## Rivine: a blockchain for store of value

The Rivine blockchain technology is a proof of blockstake blockchain. A proof of blockstake blockchain is a permissioned blockchain protocol where the stake is handed to a known group of servers running the blockchain software. Every server has one blockstake (token) which allows this server to be known as an official (permissioned) blockchain node.

Proof of blockstake blockchains operate on a principle where, every time when consensus needs to be reached, a "lottery" is conducted to select the single node that gets the authority to secure a block of information. Once this node is selected the node creates a hash over a number of data points, historical (2000 blocks) and current to secure the block. After doing this, the selected node shares the hash with other nodes for them to verify that the hash is correct, and consensus is reached amongst the permissioned nodes.

By using historical and current information to create the hash, the blockchain is secure by the fact that the work required to redo all the historical blocks used to create the hash is enormous.

The Proof Of BlockStake protocol (POBS) is a lot more efficient compared to the other blockchain protocol used, called Proof Of Work (POW). While the POBS consensus algorithm is happening in a known group of blockchain nodes by conducting a **lottery**, the POW algorithm is an actual **race** to solve a puzzle. The consensus mechanism is working on an unknown number of nodes competing in a race – the node that solves the puzzle first wins and therefore is selected as the node to secure the block. Once that has happened the whole thing (race) starts over again. All the effort to solve the puzzle is wasted and not used for anything but selecting the node to secure the block.

The Rivine technology offers a very elegant and efficient, energy-friendly solution for digital currencies.

We have resolved the Blockchain Dilemma Problem

Blockchain comes in two varieties: based on public nodes (everyone can partake) and private nodes (a known, limited amount of nodes partaking). They both have their advantages as shown in the diagram below:

The specifics of both implementations lead to the so-called blockchain dilemma – both represent good features and have specific advantages but they have not been able to be combined into one. The Rivine technology combines the advantages of both by using another TF Tech technology component (Zero-OS) to create a secure environment for such a technology to run on.

A permissioned blockchain setup requires people. In our setup, that is not the case. And because of this, the blockchain dilemma problem does not apply any longer.
